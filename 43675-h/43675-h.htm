<hr class="l15" />

<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="s08">IN THE FOREST.</span></h2>

<p>"Now you've got him, Ned!"</p>

<p>"Sh! keep quiet!"</p>

<p>The boy who was addressed as Ned was kneeling
behind a fallen oak, in a Kentucky forest, carefully
sighting at a noble buck that stood in the
middle of a natural clearing or opening, with head
upraised and antlers thrown back, as though he
scented danger, and was searching for the point
whence it threatened.</p>

<p>The splendid animal was no more than a hundred
yards distant, so that no better target could
have been offered. He was facing the youth, who
aimed at the point above his fore legs, which opened
the path to the heart of the creature.</p>

<p>The lad, who was sighting so carefully, was Ned
Preston, and his companion was a colored boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
with the unique name of Wildblossom Brown.
There was not a week's difference in their ages,
each having been born four years before the immortal
Declaration of Independence. As the date
on which we introduce him to the reader was the
autumn of 1788, the years of the two may be calculated
without trouble.</p>

<p>Ned Preston, as he drew bead on the deer, was
as certain of bringing him down as he was of
"barking" the gray squirrel, when it chirped its
mimic defiance from the topmost limbs of the
gnarled oak or branching sycamore.</p>

<p>Wildblossom, or "Blossom," as he was invariably
called, was anxious that his young master
should not miss, for the chilly autumn day was
drawing to a close, and they had eaten nothing
since morning. They were eager to reach the
block-house, known as Fort Bridgman, and scarcely
allowed themselves any halt for many hours;
but night was closing in, and they must soon go
into camp; food was therefore as indispensable as
fire.</p>

<p>The deliberation of Ned Preston led Blossom to
fear the game would bound away before the trigger
was pulled. When, therefore, the African saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the long brown barrel pointed for several seconds
at the animal, he became impatient, and uttered
the words given above.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a flash, and the
buck made a prodigious bound, dashed straight toward
the fallen tree behind which the boys were
crouching, and fell within fifty feet of them.</p>

<p>"Dar's our supper suah's yo' born!" shouted
the delighted negro, making a strong effort to leap
over the prostrate oak so as to reach the game
ahead of his companion. He would have succeeded
if the oak had lain somewhat nearer the
ground. As it was, he landed on his head and
shoulders, and rolled over; but he was unharmed,
and scrambling to his feet, ran to the deer.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was but a brief distance behind
him, trailing his long rifle, walking rapidly, and
very much puzzled over what was certainly an extraordinary
occurrence; for although he had aimed
at the buck, pulled the trigger, and the game had
fallen, yet the astonishing fact remained, that Ned
had not fired his gun.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown in his excitement did not notice
that there was no report of the weapon&mdash;that, in
short, the flint-lock (percussion guns being unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
at that day) had "flashed in the pan."
When he saw the frantic leap and fall of the animal,
he supposed, as a matter of course, it had
been killed by the bullet of his young master; and
if the latter had not stopped to examine his piece,
he might have believed the same, so exactly did
the wounding of the game accord with the useless
click of the lock and flash of the powder.</p>

<p>"I didn't shoot that buck," called out Ned, as
he ran up behind Blossom; "my gun wasn't fired
at all."</p>

<p>"Dat hasn't got nuffin to do with it," was the
sturdy response of Blossom, who was bent on having
his meal without any unnecessary delay; "you
p'inted de gun at him, and he drapped; dat's sufficacious."</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> didn't kill him," insisted Ned, more
determined on solving the mystery than he was on
procuring supper.</p>

<p>"I tell you dat you did&mdash;no, you didn't!"</p>

<p>At that instant Blossom, who had drawn his
hunting-knife, stooped over to apply it to the throat
of the buck, when he gave an unexpected flirt of
his head, bringing his antlers against the boy with
such violence that he was thrown backward several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
feet. When Blossom found himself going, he made
his last remark, inasmuch as the deer just then
proved he was alive in a most emphatic manner.</p>

<p>But it was the last expiring effort, and the negro
approached him again, knowing that all danger
was past.</p>

<p>"De way ob it was dis way," he added, turning
partly around so as to face his friend, who was
examining his rifle as he poured powder from his
horn into the pan; "you p'inted dat gun ob yours
at de buck, and as he war lookin' dis way he seed
you frough de bushes, and he knowed it war no
use; so he jes' made a jump into de air, and come
down pretty near dead, so as to sabe you de expense
ob firin' off de powder, which aint very plenty in
Kentucky."</p>

<p>This explanation seemed to satisfy the one who
made it, but not his listener, who knew that the
game was brought to earth by some one else.</p>

<p>And yet he was sure he had not heard the report
of any other gun at the moment the animal
seemed to have received its death-wound, so that
it would seem some other cause must have ended
its career.</p>

<p>While Blossom was working with his knife, Ned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
caught sight of something which gave him a suspicion
of the true cause. The game lay on its
side, and that which arrested the eye of the youthful
pioneer was the feather of an Indian arrow.</p>

<p>"Turn him over," said Ned; and the lad, wondering
why he told him to do so, complied.</p>

<p>The truth was then made known. From the
side of the buck protruded a few inches of the
shaft of an Indian arrow, to which the eagle's feather
was attached. The flinty head had been
driven clean through the heart and some distance
beyond, so that the sharp point must have been
near the surface on the other side.</p>

<p>The deer scarcely ever is known to fall instantly,
no matter how it is shot; so that, with such a
formidable weapon dividing the very seat of life, it
still ran several rods before falling.</p>

<p>When Blossom saw the arrow his appetite vanished.
He stooped over, staring at it a moment,
and then suddenly straightened up and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Let's run; dis aint any place for fellers like us!"</p>

<p>And, without waiting for the advice of his young
master, the negro lad caught up his gun and made
a dash for the prostrate tree from which he had
rushed when the buck first fell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>Ned Preston was frightened beyond expression,
for that which he had discovered was proof positive
that one red man at least was close at hand;
and when the American Indian was encountered in
the Kentucky or Ohio forest, in the year of our
Lord 1788, it was wise to consider him the most
dangerous kind of an enemy.</p>

<p>Ned had poured the powder in his priming-pan
and shaken it into the tube before he caught sight
of the arrow, for he had been instructed, from the
first day he carried a gun, that, after discharging
the piece, he must not stir from his steps until it
was reloaded and ready for use again.</p>

<p>The moment he understood what killed the buck
he looked around for the Indian who did it. He
could easily tell the direction whence the missile
came, from the position of the game when struck;
but the penetrating eye of the lad could detect
nothing when he turned his gaze toward that, nor
indeed toward any other point.</p>

<p>This did not surprise him, for the nature of the
Indian leads him to be secretive in all he does;
and many a time has his most destructive work
been done without the sufferer catching a glimpse
of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>The conclusion of Ned was that a party of warriors
were in the immediate neighborhood, and that,
as an inevitable certainty, he and Blossom were at
their mercy. If they chose to send in a shower of
arrows, or fire the guns which some of them were
likely to own, nothing could save the two lads.</p>

<p>If they chose to rush forward and take the boys
captives, it was beyond the power of the youths to
escape; in fact, as Ned looked at it, the two were
already as good as prisoners, and the Indians were
only keeping in the background for a brief while,
for the sake of amusing themselves, as a cat sometimes
plays with a mouse before crunching it in her
jaws.</p>

<p>The situation was an alarming one in every
sense, but Ned Preston showed a courage that his
life on the frontier had taught him was the only
wise course in such a trying time. He stooped
over the carcase of the deer, and carefully cutting
a choice slice from it, turned about and walked
deliberately back to where Blossom was awaiting
him, behind the oak.</p>

<p>Ned's desire to break into a run and plunge off
into the woods was almost uncontrollable, and the
sensation of expecting every minute an Indian arrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
driven into his back, while resolutely keeping
down to a slow and dignified walk, was beyond
description.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown, who had started away in such
haste, so dreaded some such shot that he threw
himself behind the tree, where he lay still. He was
strongly led to this course by his affection for his
young master, whom he could not desert even for
his own benefit.</p>

<p>"Whar am de Injines?" asked Blossom, in a
husky whisper, as his friend walked around the
root of the oak and joined him.</p>

<p>"They can't be far off," was the answer of Ned,
"and there isn't any use of trying to run away from
them. There must be a war party, and when they
are ready they will come and take us. So let's
kindle a fire and cook the meat."</p>

<p>This was an amazing proposition to make, but
it was acted upon at once, extraordinary as it may
seem. Blossom was very nervous while gathering
wood and giving what assistance he could. He
continually glanced around him, and peeped furtively
over the trunk, wondering why the red men
did not come forward and take them prisoners.</p>

<p>The youths were so accustomed to camping out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
that it was an easy matter to prepare their evening
meal. They would have preferred the venison not
quite so fresh, but they were glad enough to get
it as it was; and when they sprinkled some of the
salt and pepper, always carried with them, on the
crisp, juicy steak, it was as toothsome and luscious
as a couple of hungry hunters could wish.</p>

<p>True, the circumstances under which the meal
was eaten were not conducive to enjoyment, for no
person can be expected to feel unrestrained happiness
when surrounded by a party of treacherous
red men, who are likely to send in a shower of arrows,
or a volley of bullets, just as you are raising
a piece of meat to your mouth.</p>

<p>And yet, despite all that, Ned Preston and Blossom
Brown masticated and swallowed the last
morsel of the liberal piece taken from the buck
slain by the Indian arrow.</p>

<p>The bleak, blustery autumn day was drawing to
a close, when the boys arose to their feet, uncertain
what was the best to do in the extraordinary
situation.</p>

<p>The sky had been overcast during the afternoon,
though there were no indications of an immediate
storm. The wind blew strongly at times, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
dull, moaning sound, through the trees, from
which the leaves rustled downward in showers.
Now and then a few flakes of snow drifted on the
air for some minutes before fluttering to the ground.
Everything betokened the coming of winter, and,
though it was the royal season for game, yet there
was something so impressive in the autumn forest,
now that the seasons were sinking into decay and
death, that Ned Preston, sturdy and practical
though he was, could not avoid a feeling of sadness
when he set out from his home for the Block
House, thirty miles away.</p>

<p>"Ned, what am de use ob loafin' round here?"
asked Blossom a minute after they rose from their
supper. "If dem Injines don't want to come forrard
and speak to us, what's de use ob waiting for
'em?"</p>

<p>There was some wisdom in this question, and it
was one that had presented itself to Ned while
thoughtfully eating his venison steak.</p>

<p>Was it not possible that the warrior who fired
the fatal arrow believed the boys belonged to a
large party of white hunters and scouts, and had
withdrawn long before? Was there not a chance
of getting away by a sudden dash?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>Night was not far off, and if they could keep
out of the hands of the red men until then there
was good ground for hoping they would elude them
altogether.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be gained by discussing or thinking
over the matter, and Ned acted at once.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he whispered to Blossom, "and
don't make any noise."</p>

<p>The young hunter, trailing his rifle, stooped forward
as far as he could without impeding the
power to walk, and then ran directly from the tree,
and back over the path that had brought them to
the clearing.</p>

<p>Blossom was at his heels, traveling quite rapidly;
but glancing behind him so often, he stumbled
more than once. The negro had quick eyesight,
and once when he turned his head he saw something
flutter in the forest behind him; then there
was what seemed to be the flitting shadow of a
bird's wing as it shot by with the speed of a
bullet.</p>

<p>But at the same instant a faint whizz caught
his ear, and some object whisked past his cheek
and over the shoulder of the crouching Ned Preston.
The African had scarcely time to know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
such a thing had taken place when he heard a
quick thud, and there it was!</p>

<p>From the solid trunk of a massive maple projected
an arrow, whose head was buried in the
bark; the shaft, with the eagle's feather, still tremulous
from the force with which it had been driven
from the bow.</p>

<p>The same Indian who had brought down the
buck had sent a second missile over the heads of
the fugitives, and so close indeed that the two
might well pause and ask themselves whether it
was worth their while to run from such an unerring
archer, who had the power to bring them down
with as much certainty as though he fired the rifle
of Daniel Boone or Simon Kenton.</p>

<p>But neither Ned Preston nor Blossom Brown
was the one to stand still when he had the opportunity
of fleeing from danger. They scarcely halted,
therefore, for one glance at the significant
missile, when they made a slight turn to the left,
and plunged into the woods with all the speed
they could command.

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="s08">THE BOY PIONEER&mdash;DEERFOOT, THE SHAWANOE.</span></h2>

<p>Before proceeding further it is proper to give
the information the reader needs in order to
understand the incidents that follow.</p>

<p>Macaiah Preston and his wife were among the
original settlers of Wild Oaks, a small town on the
Kentucky side of the Ohio, during the latter portion
of the last century, their only child being Ned,
who has already been introduced to the reader.
Beside him they had the bound boy Wildblossom
Brown, a heavy-set, good-natured and sturdy negro
lad, whom they took with them at the time
they removed from Western Pennsylvania. He
was faithful and devoted, and he received the best
of treatment from his master and mistress.</p>

<p>Ned was taller and more graceful than the African,
and the instruction from his father had endowed
him with more book learning than generally
falls to the lot of boys placed in his circumstances.
Besides this, Mr. Preston was one of the most noted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
hunters and marksmen in the settlement, and he
gave Ned thorough training in the art which is
always such a delight for a boy to acquire.</p>

<p>When Ned was thirteen years old he fired one
day at a squirrel on the topmost branch of a mountain
ash, and brought it down, with its body shattered
by the bullet of his rifle. The father quietly
contemplated the work for a minute or so, and
then, without a word, cut a hickory stick, and proceeded
to trim it. While he was thus employed
Ned was looking sideways at him, gouging his
eyes with his knuckles and muttering,</p>

<p>"You might excuse me this time&mdash;I didn't
think."</p>

<p>When the hickory was properly trimmed, the
father deliberately took his son by his coat collar
with one hand and applied the stick with the other,
during which the lad danced and shouted like a
wild Miami Indian. The trouncing completed, the
only remark made by the father was&mdash;</p>

<p>"After this I reckon when you shoot a squirrel
you will hit him in the <i>head</i>."</p>

<p>"I reckon I will," sniffled Ned, who was certain
never to forget the instructions of his parent
on <i>that</i> point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the training of Ned Preston; and at
the age of sixteen, when we introduce him to the
reader, there were none of his years who was his
superior in backwoods "lore" and woodcraft.</p>

<p>In those times a hunter differed in his make-up
from those of to-day. The gun which he carried
was a long, single-barreled rifle, heavy, costly of
manufacture, and scarcely less unerring in the
hands of a veteran than is the modern weapon. It
was a flint-lock, and of course a muzzle-loader.
The owner carried his powder-horn, bullet-pouch,
and sometimes an extra flint. Lucifer matches
were unknown for nearly a half century later, the
flint and tinder answering for them.</p>

<p>Ned Preston wore a warm cap made of coonskin;
thick, homespun trowsers, coat and vest;
strong cowhide shoes, and woollen stockings, knit
by the same deft hands that had made the linen
for his shirt. The coat was rather short, and it
was buttoned from top to bottom with the old
style horn button, over the short waistcoat beneath.
The string of the powder-horn passed over one
shoulder, and that of the game-bag over the other.
Neither Ned nor Blossom carried a hunting-bag,
for they had not started out for game, and the majority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
shot in Kentucky or Ohio in those days were
altogether too bulky for a single hunter to take
home on his back.</p>

<p>Some thirty miles in the interior from the settlement
stood Fort Bridgman, a block-house on
the eastern bank of the Licking River. It was
erected six years before the time of which we are
speaking, and was intended as a protection to a
settlement begun at the same period; but, just as
the fortification was finished, and before the settlers
had all their dwellings in good form, the
Shawanoes and Wyandots swooped down on
them, and left nothing but the block-house and
the smoking ruins of the log dwellings.</p>

<p>This effectually checked the settlers for the
time; but one or two courageous pioneers, who
liked the locality, began erecting other cabins close
to the massive block-house, which had resisted the
fierce attack of the red men. The man who had
charge of the fortification was Colonel Hugh Preston,
a brother of Macaiah, and of course the uncle
of Ned, the hero of this story. He maintained his
foothold, with several others as daring as he, and
his wife and two daughters kept him company.</p>

<p>There was a warm affection between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
brothers, and they occasionally exchanged visits.
When this was inconvenient, Ned Preston acted as
messenger. He often carried papers sent down the
Ohio to his father for the uncle, together with the
letters forwarded to the settlement from their
friends in the East.</p>

<p>On the day of which we are speaking he had, in
the inner pocket of his coat, a letter for his uncle,
one for his aunt, and one each for two of the garrison;
so that his visit to the post was sure to be a
most welcome one.</p>

<p>Between the settlement on the Ohio and the
block-house on the Licking lay the thirty miles
of unbroken forest. Ned and Blossom had made
this journey in one day in the month of June, but
their custom was to encamp one night on the way
so as to give themselves abundance of time; and
the trip was generally a most enjoyable one to
them.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed they forgot the danger
most to be dreaded was from the Indians who
roamed over the Dark and Bloody Ground, and
who held almost undisputed possession of hundreds
of square miles of Kentucky at the opening
of the present century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>There were scouts and runners threading their
way through the trackless forests north and south
of the Ohio, or coursing up and down the rivers,
or spying out the actions of the war parties when
they gathered near their villages and threw the
tomahawk, daubed their faces with paint, and
danced the war dance. These intrepid runners
kept the frontier well informed of any formidable
movements contemplated by the red men, so that
no effective demonstration against the whites was
feared.</p>

<p>Weeks and months passed, during which Ned
Preston was not permitted to cross the intervening
space between the block-house and the settlement,
for the runners who came in reported great danger
in doing so. Then again it looked almost as if the
dawn of peace had come, and men were not afraid
to move to and fro many furlongs distant from their
homes.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years had passed since the great
pioneer, Daniel Boone, had explored a portion of
the wonderful territory, and the numerous scenes
of violence that had taken place on its soil made
the name of the Dark and Bloody Ground characteristic
and well-merited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>The several military expeditions which the Government
had sent into the West had either been
overwhelmingly defeated by the combined forces of
Indians, or had accomplished nothing toward subduing
the red men. The decisive campaign was
yet to come.</p>

<p>But without dwelling on this portion of our
story, we may say that in the autumn of 1788 comparative
peace reigned over the portion of Kentucky
of which we are speaking. When, therefore,
the letters came down the Ohio in a flat-boat for
Colonel Hugh Preston and several of those with
him, and Ned asked permission to take them to
his uncle, there was scarcely any hesitation in giving
consent.</p>

<p>With this explanation the reader will understand
how it came about that Ned and Blossom
were in the depths of the Kentucky forest when
the autumn day was closing, and while fully a
dozen miles remained to pass before they could
reach the block-house.</p>

<p>They had made a later start than usual from
home, and rather singularly, although they had
passed over the route so many times, they went
astray, and lost several hours from that cause.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after their departure from the settlement
a friendly Shawanoe visited the place and warned
the pioneers that trouble was coming, and it was
wise to take more than usual precautions against
surprise. When this Indian runner added that he
was quite sure an assault was intended on the
block-house, it can be understood that the parents
of Ned were extremely alarmed for the safety of
himself and Blossom.</p>

<p>If they should get through the stretch of forest
to the block-house, their danger would not be removed;
for an attack on that post was contemplated,
and knowing its precise defensive power,
as the Indians did, they would be likely to render
the battle decisive.</p>

<p>"I hope the boys will reach the Colonel," said
the father of Ned to his wife, "for they will have
a chance to make a good fight for themselves."</p>

<p>"But the Colonel may know nothing of the attack
intended, and he and the rest will be taken
by surprise."</p>

<p>This doubt so disturbed the husband that he
hurriedly sought the Shawanoe, who was still in the
settlement, and asked him whether Colonel Preston
had been apprised of the danger which threatened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
him. When informed that he had not,
Mr. Preston insisted that Deerfoot, as the young
Shawanoe was called, should make his way to the
block-house without delay. The Indian, known
to be one of the fleetest of warriors, said that he
was on the eve of starting on that errand, and he
left at once.</p>

<p>Before going, he was told that the two boys were
threading their way through the forest toward the
station, and the anxious father asked him to bring
the lads back, if he deemed it the safer course.
Ned was a great favorite with the Shawanoe youth,
and the latter promised to use every effort to befriend
him.</p>

<p>The question left to Deerfoot was whether it was
his duty to hasten forward and apprise Colonel
Preston of the peril impending over the garrison,
or whether it would be safe to let him wait until
the lads were conducted back to Wild Oaks. Deerfoot
was disposed to hurry to the Licking; but
when a few miles from the settlement he struck
the trail of the lads, which he followed with as
much ease as the bloodhound would have displayed
under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>As both parties had started in the same direction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the prospect was that a junction would speedily
take place, and the three could make the rest of
the journey together; but before long Deerfoot
was surprised to discover that Ned and Blossom
had strayed from the true course. He could not
understand why this happened, and his misgiving
for Ned, whom he liked so well, led him to resolve
to follow up the boy, and find out the cause.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was pushing forward on his loping trot,
which he was able to maintain hour after hour
without fatigue, when his wonderful instinct or
reason told him he was in the vicinity of a large
war party of Wyandots, the natural allies of his
own tribe in their wars upon the settlements.</p>

<p>His belief was that the boys had been captured
by them, in which event little hope remained;
but it required no special maneuvering
on his part to learn that his fears were baseless.
The trail of the lads made an abrupt turn, showing
that Ned Preston had suddenly "located" himself,
and had returned to the right course. Although
the footprints of the Wyandots actually
approached within a hundred yards of those of the
boys, yet singularly enough they came no nearer,
and diverged from that point; so that, in all probability,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the war party never suspected how close
they were to the prize that would have been so
welcome to them.</p>

<p>Accustomed as Deerfoot was to all species of
danger in the woods, his dusky face flushed when
he looked to the ground and saw how narrowly
the boys had missed a frightful fate.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it became the duty of the
Shawanoe to acquaint himself with the purpose of
the Wyandot party. He therefore went directly
among them to make his inquiries. This was a
delicate and dangerous proceeding, for although
the subtle Indian had done his utmost to keep
secret from his own people his friendship and services
for the whites (inasmuch as such a knowledge
on the part of his race would have ended his usefulness
and life), he knew well enough that his
double-dealing must become known sooner or later
to the Indians, and for a year or more he had never
appeared among his people without misgiving as
to the result.</p>

<p>All the wonderful cunning of his nature was
brought into play when he advanced to meet the
Wyandots, who were in their war-paint. He saw
there were twenty-three, and that they numbered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the bravest and most daring of their tribe.
The leader was the chief Waughtauk, a fierce
foe of the whites, whose tomahawk and scalping-knife
had been reddened with innocent blood
many a time.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was received with every appearance of
cordiality by the chief and his men, for all knew
what a splendid warrior the young Shawanoe was,
and some of them had witnessed the extraordinary
speed which had saved his life more than once.</p>

<p>It is as easy for the American to play a part as
for the Caucasian, and Deerfoot was not entirely
satisfied. He kept his wits about him, and used
extreme care in not placing himself at any disadvantage
which it was possible to avoid; but all
the friendship seemed genuine, and when Waughtauk
told him it was his intention to attack the
exposed cabins of the settlers, Deerfoot believed
him. When he added that he meant also to take
a survey of the settlements along the Ohio, with
the object of seeing which offered the most favorable
opening for a sudden assault by a large war
party, the Shawanoe was quite certain he spoke
the truth.</p>

<p>Deerfoot then asked why they did not assail the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
block-house on the Licking, whose exposed situation
seemed to invite such attack. Waughtauk
answered that Colonel Preston had proved a good
friend to the Indians who visited him, and it was
decided to spare him.</p>

<p>This answer excited the suspicion of the youthful
Shawanoe that the Wyandot chieftain had been
deceiving him from the first; but Deerfoot was
too cunning to reveal anything of his thoughts.
When he bade his friends good-by, they at least
were misled into the belief that he held no suspicion
of the "double tongue" with which they had
spoken.</p>

<p>It was no difficult matter for Deerfoot, when
fairly away from the Wyandots, to shadow
them until he learned whether they had falsified
or not.</p>

<p>They kept to the northward several miles, until
they had every reason to believe a long distance
separated them from the Shawanoe, when they
changed to the left, turning again a short distance
further on, until their faces were directly toward
Fort Bridgman, the block-house on the Licking.</p>

<p>That settled the question beyond dispute; they
had told untruths to Deerfoot, and their purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
was to descend upon the station defended by
Colonel Preston and only three able-bodied men.</p>

<p>After this discovery, the Shawanoe stood a moment
leaning thoughtfully on his bow; an important
truth impressed him:</p>

<p>"They suspect that Deerfoot is a friend of the
white man, and therefore an enemy of his own
race," was the thought of the Indian, who realized
the fearful meaning to him of such a suspicion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="s08">OLD FRIENDS.</span></h2>

<p>The discharge of the second arrow over the head
and shoulders of Ned Preston and Wildblossom
Brown lent wings to their flight; instead of
coming to a standstill, as they did a short time before,
they bent all their energies to escape, and ran
with the utmost speed.</p>

<p>In such an effort the advantage was on the side
of Ned as compared with the negro, for he was
much more fleet of foot, and, as a consequence,
within two or three minutes he was almost beyond
sight.</p>

<p>"Hold on dar!" shouted Blossom; "dat aint
de fair ting to leave a chap dat way."</p>

<p>Ned Preston could not desert the lad in this
fashion, though it would not help him to stay behind
and share his fate.</p>

<p>But his own disposition and the training received
from his father led him to reproach himself for
leaving him even for so short a time. He therefore
stopped, and called back&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurry, Blossom; every minute counts."</p>

<p>"Dat's jes' what I am a doin'," panted Blossom,
struggling forward; "but I never could run
as well as you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment Ned Preston, who was looking
toward the African, caught sight of an Indian
close behind him. The warrior was in close pursuit,
though the intervening vegetation for the
moment prevented the young pioneer from seeing
him distinctly. Enough was visible, however, to
make his aim sure, and Ned brought his rifle to
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I hear de Injines! Dey're right behind me!"
shouted the terrified Blossom; "get 'em in range,
Ned, and shoot 'em all!"</p>

<p>Such a performance as this was out of the question,
as a matter of course, but the boy was determined
to do his utmost to help his friend.</p>

<p>When Ned raised his gun there was but the
single warrior visible, and the sight of him was
indistinct; but it was enough to make the aim
certain, and the youth felt that one red man
was certain to pay for his vindictiveness. At
the same time he wondered why no others were
seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>But at the very moment the finger of Ned was
pressing the trigger, the Indian disappeared as suddenly
as if he had dropped through the mouth of
a cavern. The target at which the gun was aimed
had vanished.</p>

<p>Mystified and astounded, Ned Preston lowered
his piece and stared at the point where the red
man was last seen, as if he doubted his own senses.
At the same moment a suppressed whoop was
heard, and the warrior stepped to view from behind
the sycamore, where he had leaped to dodge
the bullet of the rifle which he saw aimed at him.</p>

<p>Ned was in the act of raising his gun again, when
he almost let it fall from his grasp, with the exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Deerfoot!</span>"</p>

<p>As the single word fell from his lips, his eyes
rested on the figure of a young Indian of singular
grace and beauty, who, without regarding the bewildered
Blossom, walked forward to greet Ned
Preston.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i038" id="i038"></a>
<img src="images/i-038.jpg" width="550" height="394" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Meeting with Deerfoot.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe, at the most, was no
more than a year older than young Preston. He
was about the same height, but of lighter mould,
and with a length of lower limbs and a suppleness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of frame which betokened great natural abilities as
a runner: when we add that these capabilities had
been cultivated to the highest point, it will not
seem unreasonable that Deerfoot's unequalled
swiftness of foot was known to several tribes besides
his own.</p>

<p>Although a Shawanoe by birth (which tribe at
that day had their hunting-grounds north of the
Ohio), Deerfoot roamed through the forests south,
and the exploits of the youth in running were told
in the lodges by the camp-fires of the Shawanoe,
the Wyandot, the Miami, the Delaware, and the
Cherokee.</p>

<p>His expertness with the bow and arrow, his
bravery in battle, his skill on the hunt, the fact
that his mother was shot by settlers, and his
father was killed in the famous Crawford expedition,
caused Deerfoot to be formally ranked as a
warrior when he was only fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>His deftness with his primitive weapons was no
less remarkable than his fleetness of foot. Had he
been living to-day, he would have taken the prize
at the annual archery tournaments, even though
he used a hickory bow instead of the double-backed
yew or lancewood, and his missiles were made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the former material, with a single feather instead
of the three, and were tied instead of being glued
in place.</p>

<p>The bow and arrows of Deerfoot would have
made a sorry show among those of the fair ladies
and graceful gentlemen at the archery contests in
these times; but those same shafts of the dusky
American, with the keen flint or iron heads, had
been driven by him with such prodigious force that
they had found the heart of the deer or bear or
bison at scarcely less than a hundred yards.</p>

<p>Deerfoot therefore refused to use the rifle, but
clung to the bow, whose use he began studying
when he was less than three years old.</p>

<p>As we have said, the young Shawanoe, now no
more than seventeen years of age, was graceful of
figure, with elastic, supple limbs, and with a perfect
symmetry of frame. When he smiled, which
happened now and then, he disclosed two rows of
teeth as white, even, and beautiful, and free from
decay, as ever existed. The nose was slightly
aquiline, the eyes as black and piercing as those
of a serpent, the forehead high, the cheek bones
slightly prominent, the whole expression pervaded
by that slight tinge of melancholy which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
seems to be the characteristic of the American
race.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's costume and dress were those of the
defiant warrior, who was the implacable foe of the
white man. His hair, as long, black and coarse as
that of a horse's mane, was gathered in a knot or
scalp-lock on the crown, where it was tied and ornamented
with eagle feathers, that were stained
several brilliant hues; his hunting-shirt encased
his sinewy arms, chest and waist, the ornamented
skirt descending to his knees. The whole garment,
made of buckskin obtained from the traders,
was of a yellow color, the fringe being a deep crimson.
Deerfoot shared the love of his people for
flaring colors, as was shown by his handsomely
decorated moccasins which encased his shapely
feet, the various-hued fringes of his leggings, the
string of bright beads around his neck, and the
golden bracelet that he wore on his left wrist.</p>

<p>The red leathern belt, which clasped the waist
of the young Shawanoe, formed a pretty contrast
to the pale yellow of the hunting-shirt, and, a
short distance off, would have been taken for the
crimson sash worn by the civilized officer of modern
times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>Behind this belt were thrust a tomahawk and
hunting-knife, both keen of edge and terribly effective
in the hands of the owner. The bundle of
arrows was supported by a string passing around
the neck, the missiles themselves resting behind
the shoulder, the feathered points plainly seen by
any one as they projected upward in front. In this
place they were so accessible that Deerfoot, in discharging
them at a foe or an animal, would have
two or three in the air at the same time, there being
what might be called a procession of arrows
from the bow to the target, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>In the coldest weather, the youthful warrior
gathered a heavy blanket about his shoulders,
which hid all his figure, from his chin down to his
twinkling moccasins. During the sultry season he
occasionally threw off his hunting-shirt, except the
skirt, so that arm, chest and neck were covered
only by the rude figures which the mother had tattooed
there by a most painful process during the
days when Pa-wa-oo-pa, or Deerfoot, was a stoical
papoose, tied to a flat piece of bark, and swinging
in the tree branches, or lying motionless on the
ground with limbs tied, and calmly watching the
torturing operation with the bravery which is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
part of the nature of the dusky hunters of the
forest.</p>

<p>The bow of Deerfoot was of seasoned hickory,
the string was dried sinew, and the weapon itself
was all of six feet in length; so that, in discharging
it, he did not hold it perpendicular, as is the
rule, but in a slanting position; in short, the young
Shawanoe violated more than one fundamental regulation
in archery, but the fact remained that he
could spit the gray squirrel on the top of the tallest
oak; he could bring down the buck when leaping
through the air; he had driven his sharp-pointed
shaft through the shaggy body of the bison, and
had brought the eagle flapping and dying to the
ground when circling in the clear air far above his
head.</p>

<p>Two years before, Deerfoot was the most vindictive
enemy of the pioneers, who had slain both his
father and mother. While attacking some settlers'
cabins near Maysville, with nearly a score of other
Shawanoes, they were surprised and almost annihilated
by a party of whites led by Macaiah Preston,
father of Ned. Deerfoot was wounded and taken
captive. He fought like a young tiger, and the
settlers, who knew his extraordinary skill and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
injury he had done them, insisted on putting him
to death.</p>

<p>But Macaiah Preston interposed, and would not
permit it. He took him to his own home, and
carefully nursed him back to rugged health and
strength.</p>

<p>On the part of the good Samaritan he was assisted
by his wife and Ned, who formed a strong
attachment for the captive Shawanoe. The young
brave more than reciprocated this friendship, the
sentiment of gratitude being the most characteristic
trait in his nature. He became henceforth the
unfaltering ally and friend of the white race; from
the bitterest enemy he was transformed into the
most devoted friend, his fervency, like that of Saul
of Tarsus, being as extreme as was his previous
hatred.</p>

<p>The better to aid the settlers, Deerfoot returned
to his own people, and kept up the semblance of
enmity toward the pioneers. He even took part
in several expeditions against them, but all proved
disastrous failures to the assailants, and the youth
did most effective service for those whom he had
fought so fiercely a short time before.</p>

<p>It was of the utmost importance to Deerfoot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
that his true sentiments and real doings should be
concealed from his people; for whenever the truth
should become known to them, the most frightful
death that could be conceived would be visited
upon him.</p>

<p>The daring warrior believed his secret must be
discovered; he believed he would fall a victim to
their terrible vengeance sooner or later; but he
was none the less faithful to the settlers. He simply
resolved that he would never submit tamely to
his fate; but, if the aborigines secured him for
torment, it would be done by superior daring and
subtlety.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the youthful Shawanoe was
playing a most perilous and dangerous part; but
he had played it so well that not until to-day had
he seen just cause to believe any suspicion was
afloat concerning himself.</p>

<p>The action of the Wyandots indicated that they
preferred not to trust him with their secret. It was
the first time anything of the kind had occurred,
and it could not but cause uneasiness in the mind
of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>It did not affect in the least, however, his course
of action. He had set out to befriend Ned Preston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
and Wildblossom Brown, and it was his purpose
to apprise Colonel Preston at Fort Bridgman
of the danger to which his block-house was exposed.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot!" exclaimed Ned Preston, stepping
hastily toward him and extending his hand; "I
never was more glad to see you in all my life."</p>

<p>The handsome mouth of the Shawanoe expanded
just enough to show the white teeth between the
dusky lips, and he took the hand of Ned and
pressed it warmly, immediately allowing the palm
to drop from his own.</p>

<p>Then, without speaking, he turned toward Blossom,
who, having seen how matters stood, was
scrambling rapidly forward to greet the young warrior,
whom he knew so well, and who was the
most valuable companion they could have at such
a time.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was left-handed by birth, but he had
trained himself until he was ambidextrous, and
he could draw the bow, hurl the tomahawk or wield
the scalping-knife with the right as well as with
the left hand.</p>

<p>In no single respect, perhaps, was his mental
power more clearly shown than in the celerity with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
which he acquired the English language. When
several years younger he was able to hold a conversation
with the traders; and during the short time
he remained with Macaiah Preston, before "escaping"
to his people again, he became so proficient
that he could readily act as interpreter.</p>

<p>"War dat you dat fired dat arrer at us?"
demanded Wildblossom, as he caught the hand
of Deerfoot, who nodded his head, with just a
shadowy smile.</p>

<p>The American Indian, as a rule, does not like
the African race, and he often shows an unreasonable
prejudice against him. There seemed to be
such a distaste on the part of Deerfoot, but he
concealed it so well that Blossom Brown never
suspected its existence. He treated the negro lad
kindly because he belonged to the Prestons, whom
the Shawanoe loved above all others.</p>

<p>"I thought you war a better shot dan to miss
us," added Blossom, with the purpose of teasing
their dusky friend; "your arrer neber teched me
nor Ned."</p>

<p>"Did it hit the buck?" asked Deerfoot, smiling
a little more decisively.</p>

<p>"Dat war 'cause you war so close to him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>"Deerfoot stood further away than did his white
brother, who harmed him not with his gun."</p>

<p>"That was because my rifle missed fire," Ned
hastened to explain; "if it was not for that, the
buck would have fallen in his tracks."</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> gun never misses fire," said the Shawanoe,
holding up the bow with no little pride.</p>

<p>"But it misses folks dat it am p'inted at," remarked
Blossom, reaching out and giving Deerfoot
a nudge in the back.</p>

<p>"Will my brother with the face of the night,
walk a long ways in the wood and let Deerfoot
send a single arrow toward him?"</p>

<p>There was a gleam in the dark eye of the young
Shawanoe as he made this request, and no doubt it
would have proven a dangerous challenge for Blossom
to accept. The negro himself did not notice
the full significance of the question, but Ned Preston
did, and he trembled over the temerity of
Blossom, who believed that Deerfoot felt as strong
friendship for him as he himself felt for the matchless
young warrior.</p>

<p>Unsuspicious of the slumbering storm, the African
lad fortunately took the very best course to
avert it. Shaking his head with a laugh, he said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"Dar aint no better rifle-shots dan masser Ned
dar; and I'd radder stand up afore him a hundred
yards off, and let him draw bead on me, dan hab
Deerfoot send one ob dem arrers whizzin' arter dis
chile."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="s08">THROUGH THE TRACKLESS FOREST&mdash;THE CAUSE.</span></h2>

<p>The compliment to the young Shawanoe, although
rudely expressed, was genuine, and at
once dissipated the latent lightning that was on
the point of bursting forth.</p>

<p>The lowering eclipse that overspread the dusky
countenance instantly cleared away, and Deerfoot
smiled more than before as he turned toward Ned
Preston to see how he accepted the remark of
his servant.</p>

<p>The young pioneer was pleased, and, slapping
the lad on the shoulder, exclaimed heartily&mdash;</p>

<p>"You show your good sense there, Blossom;
and after this, when I hear the folks say you are
the stupidest boy in all Kentucky, I will quote
what you have just said to prove they are mistaken."</p>

<p>Wildblossom raised his cap and scratched his
head, somewhat doubtful as to how he should accept
this remark. While he was considering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
matter, Deerfoot and Ned faced each other, and
talked concerning more important matters.</p>

<p>The sun, which had been scarcely visible during
the day, was now below the horizon, and the shadows
of night were creeping through the autumn
woods. The air continued chilly, and moaned
among the branches, from which the crisp leaves,
turning from bright yellow and flaming crimson to
dull brown, were continually drifting downward.
The squirrels whisked from limb to limb, gathering
their winter store of nuts, and chattering their
defiance from the highest branches of elm, oak,
ash, hickory, chestnut, or maple.</p>

<p>Now and then feathery particles of snow whirled
around them, so light and downy that they scarcely
found their way to the leaves below. It was the
time of the sad and melancholy days, though the
most joyous one to the hunter.</p>

<p>Ned Preston had been told by Deerfoot that he
was the only Indian near them, and he was vastly
relieved that the danger was found to be scarcely
any danger at all.</p>

<p>As it was becoming colder, and night was closing
in, the boy was anxious to go into camp. He
could conceive of no reason why they should push
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
forward any further before morning, as he held no
suspicion of the critical condition of affairs.</p>

<p>But he quickly learned the truth from Deerfoot,
who related, in his pointed way, the story of the
Wyandots under the fierce war chief Waughtauk.</p>

<p>"And they are going to the block-house!" exclaimed
the astonished lad.</p>

<p>The young warrior nodded his head to signify
there could be no doubt of the fact.</p>

<p>"Then we had better turn around and go back
to Wild Oaks as quickly as we can."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot must hurry to Colonel Preston and
tell him of the Wyandots," said the Shawanoe;
"that is Deerfoot's first duty."</p>

<p>"Of course; I didn't expect you to go with us;
we can make our way home without help."</p>

<p>"But your feet wandered from the path only a
few hours ago."</p>

<p>"We were careless, for we felt there was no need
of haste," replied young Preston; "that could
not happen again, when we know such a mistake
might work us ill."</p>

<p>"But that was in the daytime; it is now
night."</p>

<p>Ned felt the force of this fact, but he would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
have hesitated to start on the back trail without
a minute's delay.</p>

<p>"When we found we were going wrong we could
stop and wait till the rising of the morning sun.
I have several letters which you can deliver to my
uncle."</p>

<p>Deerfoot shook his head; he had another course
in mind.</p>

<p>"We will go to the fort; you will hand the letters
to the white soldier; Deerfoot will show the
way."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot knows best; we will follow in his
footsteps."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was pleased with the readiness
of the young pioneer, who, it must be stated,
could not see the wisdom of the decision of their
guide.</p>

<p>If Waughtauk and his warriors were in the immediate
vicinity of the block-house, the boys must
run great risk in an attempt to enter the post.
They could not reach the station ahead of the Wyandots,
and it would be a task of extreme difficulty
to open communication with Colonel Preston,
even though he knew the loyalty of the dusky ally
of the whites.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Deerfoot would have a much better prospect of
success alone than if embarrassed by two companions,
whom the other Indians would consider in
the light of the very game for which they were
hunting.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ned that it would be far more
prudent for the young Shawanoe to take the letters
and make his way through the trackless forest,
while Ned and Blossom spared no time or effort in
returning to Wild Oaks.</p>

<p>But the matchless subtlety and skill of Deerfoot
were appreciated by no one more than by
young Preston, who unhesitatingly placed himself
under his charge.</p>

<p>But cheerfully as the wishes of the Shawanoe
were acceded to by the white boy, the African lad
was anything but satisfied. Of a sluggish temperament,
he disliked severe exertion. He had not
only been on the tramp most of the day, but, during
the last half hour, had been forced to an exertion
which had tired him out; he therefore objected
to a tramp that was likely to take the better
portion of the night.</p>

<p>"We'd better start a fire here," said he, "and
den in de mornin' we'll be fresh, and we can run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
all de way to de Lickin', and get dar 'bout as soon
as if we trabel all night and got tired most to def."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe turned upon him in the dusky
twilight, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brother with the face of the night may
wait here; Deerfoot and his friend will go on
alone."</p>

<p>With which decisive remark he wheeled about,
and, facing southwest, strode off toward the block-house
on the Licking.</p>

<p>"Wildblossom aint gwine to stay here, not if he
knows hisself, while you folks go to your destruction,"
exclaimed the servant, falling into line.</p>

<p>The strange procession was under way at once.
Deerfoot, as a matter of course, took the lead,
Ned Preston stepping close behind him, while the
African kept so near his young master that he trod
on his heels more than once.</p>

<p>The Shawnee displayed his marvellous woodcraft
from the first. Although the ground was thickly
strewn with leaves, his soft moccasins touched
them as lightly as do the velvet paws of the tiger
when stealing through the jungle. Ned Preston
took extreme care to imitate him, and partially
succeeded, but the large shoes of Blossom Brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
rumpled and tumbled the dry vegetation despite
every effort to avoid it.</p>

<p>It was not until reproved by Ned, and the gait
was slackened, that, to a certain extent, the noisy
rustling was stopped.</p>

<p>There were no stars nor moon in the sky, there
was no beaten path to follow, and they were not on
the bank nor along the watercourse of any stream
to guide them; but the dusky leader advanced as
unerringly as does the bloodhound when trailing
the panting fugitive through the marshy swamps
and lowlands.</p>

<p>As the night deepened, Ned saw only dimly the
figure of the lithe and graceful young warrior in
front. His shoulders were thrown forward, and
his head projected slightly beyond. This was his
attitude while on the trail, and when all his
faculties were alert. Eye and ear were strained
to the highest tension, and the faint cry of a bird
or the flitting of a shadowy figure among the
forest arches would have been detected on the instant.</p>

<p>Ned Preston could catch the outlines of the
scalp-lock and eagle feathers, which took on a
slightly waving motion in response to the long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
loping tread of the Indian; occasionally he could
detect a part of the quiver, fastened back of the
shoulder, and the upper portion of the long bow,
which he carried unstrung in his right hand.</p>

<p>Then there were moments when the guide was
absolutely invisible, and he moved with such silence
that Ned feared he had left them altogether.
But he was there all the time, and the journey
through the desolate woods continued with scarcely
an interruption.</p>

<p>Suddenly Deerfoot came to a halt, giving utterance
at the same moment to a sibilant sound as a
warning to Ned Preston, who checked himself with
his chin almost upon the arrow-quiver. It was
different with Blossom, who bumped his nose
against the shoulders of his young master with
such violence that Ned put up his hand to check
himself from knocking the guide off his feet.</p>

<p>Neither Ned nor Blossom had caught the slightest
sound, and they wondered what it was that
had alarmed Deerfoot.</p>

<p>No one spoke, but all stood as motionless as the
tree trunks beside them, those behind waiting the
pleasure of him who was conducting them on this
dangerous journey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>For fully five minutes (which seemed doubly
that length) the tableau lasted, during which
the listening followers heard only the soughing
of the night-wind and the hollow murmur of
the great forest, which was like the voice of silence
itself.</p>

<p>Then the faint rustle of the leaves beneath the
moccasins of the Shawanoe showed that he was
moving forward again, and the others resumed
walking, with all the caution consistent with necessary
speed.</p>

<p>Fully a half mile was passed in this manner, the
three advancing like automata, with never a whisper
or halt. Blossom, although wearied and displeased,
appreciated the situation too well to
express his feelings, or to attempt anything to
which either of the others would object.</p>

<p>"Dey aint likely to keep dis up for more dan a
week," was the thought which came to him; "and
when I make up my mind to it, I can stand it as
long as bofe of 'em together."</p>

<p>However, Blossom had almost reached the protesting
point, when he heard the same warning
hiss from the Shawanoe, and checked himself just
in time to avoid a collision with his young master.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of this stoppage was apparent to all:
they stood on the bank of a creek a hundred yards
wide, which it was necessary to cross to reach the
block-house. It ran into the Licking a number of
miles south, and so far below Fort Bridgman that
there was no way of "going round" it to reach
the station.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the boys, when making the
journey between Wild Oaks and the block-house,
to ferry themselves over on a raft which they had
constructed, and which was used on their return.
As they took a course each time which brought
them to the same point on the tributary, this was
an easy matter. During the summer they sometimes
doffed their garments, and placing them
and their guns on a small float, swam over, pushing
their property before them.</p>

<p>The water was too cold to admit of any such
course now, unless driven to it by necessity; and
as Deerfoot had brought them to a point on the
bank far removed from the usual ferrying place,
Ned concluded they were in an unpleasant predicament,
to say the least.</p>

<p>"How are we going to get across?" he asked,
when they had stood motionless several minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
looking down on the dim current flowing at their
feet.</p>

<p>"The creek is not wide; we can swim to the
other shore."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that, for I have done it
more than once; but there is snow flying in the
air, and it isn't a favorite season with me to go in
bathing."</p>

<p>A slight exclamation escaped the Shawanoe,
which was probably meant as an expression of
contempt for the effeminacy of his white friend.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, he said nothing, nor did he,
in point of fact, mean to force the two to such a
disagreeable experience.</p>

<p>"Wait till Deerfoot comes back."</p>

<p>As he uttered these words he moved down the
bank, while Blossom Brown threw himself on the
ground, muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would like to wait here all night, and I hope
he has gone for some wood to kindle a fire."</p>

<p>"There is no likelihood of that," explained Ned,
"for he is too anxious to reach the block-house."</p>

<p>"I tink he is anxiouser dan&mdash;&mdash;<i>See dat</i>!"</p>

<p>At that moment the dip of a paddle was heard,
and the lads caught the faint outlines of a canoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
stealing along the stream close to the shore. In it
was seated a single warrior, who did not sway his
body in the least as he dipped the paddle first on
one side the frail boat and then on the other.</p>

<p>"He's arter us!" whispered Blossom, cocking
his rifle.</p>

<p>"Of course he is; it's Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"I forgot all about dat," said the lad, lowering
his piece, with no little chagrin.</p>

<p>Ned Preston now cautiously descended the bank,
followed by Blossom, and while the Shawanoe held
the craft against the shore, they stepped within,
Ned placing himself in the bow, while his companion
took a seat at the stern.</p>

<p>Then, while Deerfoot deftly poised himself in
the middle, he lightly dipped the ashen paddle
alternately on the right and left, sending the canoe
forward as gracefully as a swallow.</p>

<p>"Whose boat is that?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"It belongs to some Pottawatomie," answered
the Shawanoe, speaking with a confidence which
showed he held no doubt in the matter, though he
might have found it hard to tell his companions
the precise means by which he gained the information.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Deerfoot, instead of speeding directly across,
headed south, as though he meant to follow the
stream to its confluence with the Licking. Suspecting
he was not aware of his mistake, Blossom
deemed it his duty to remind him of it.</p>

<p>"You are gwine de wrong way, if you did but
know it, Deerfoot; de oder side am ober dar."</p>

<p>Perhaps the young Shawanoe indulged in a quiet
smile; if so, he made no other sign, but continued
down the creek with arrowy swiftness for two or
three hundred yards, when he began verging toward
the other shore.</p>

<p>Ned Preston made no remark, but alternately
peered ahead to discern where they were going,
and back, that he might admire the grace and skill
with which the Indian propelled the light structure.</p>

<p>All at once, with a sweep of the paddle, the boat
was whirled around with such suddenness that
Blossom Brown thought they were going to upset
and be precipitated into the water. By the time
he recovered himself the delicate prow touched the
shore as lightly as if drawn by a lady's hand.</p>

<p>Ned instantly stepped out, the others doing the
same. When everything was removed, Deerfoot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
stooped over, and, without any apparent effort,
raised the canoe from the water.</p>

<p>"I s'pose he am gwine to take dat along to hold
ober our heads when it rains."</p>

<p>But Blossom was altogether wide of the mark
in his theory. The Shawanoe carried it only a few
paces, when he placed it under a clump of bushes,
pulled some leaves over it, laying the paddle beneath,
and then once more turned to resume their
journey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="s08">"SHUT OUT."</span></h2>

<p>Deerfoot informed his friends that they were
now within seven miles of the block-house.
Although the night was far advanced, he expected
to reach their destination long before morning. At
that season the days were short, and as the Shawanoe
was familiar with the woods, and could travel
with as much certainty in the darkness as the
light, there was no delay counted upon, unless they
should approach the vicinity of some of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>The order of march was taken up precisely as
before, Deerfoot warning the others to walk with
the least noise possible, he setting the example by
advancing absolutely without any sound that could
betray his footsteps.</p>

<p>Ned Preston felt the touch of a few wandering
snowflakes against his cheek, but there were not
enough to show themselves on the leaves. The exercise
of walking and their thick garments kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
them sufficiently warm, though it would have been
different had they been in camp. In the latter
case, as they had no encumbering blankets, it would
have gone ill without a roaring camp-fire.</p>

<p>The journey now became monotonous, even to
young Preston, who found it tiresome to walk so
continuously without the least noise or occurrence
to awaken alarm. They must have gone at least
four miles in this manner, Blossom plodding along
with a certain dogged resolution which kept him
close on the heels of his young master.</p>

<p>The latter often felt like protesting, but nothing
could have persuaded him to do so. It would
have offended Deerfoot, who was the guide of the
party, and who was directing affairs in accordance
with his own theory of strategy. He knew that that
scout is sure to meet disaster, sooner or later, who
allows his impatience to influence his judgment, and
who fails to use the most extreme caution whenever
and wherever there is the shadow of danger.</p>

<p>When Preston began to believe they were in
the vicinity of the Licking, Deerfoot came to an
abrupt and noiseless halt. This time he spoke the
single word&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Listen!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>The two did as requested, but were unable to
detect anything beside the hollow moaning of the
wind through the trees, and the faint, almost inaudible
murmur of the distant Licking. Several
minutes passed, and then the guide asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do my brothers hear anything?"</p>

<p>They answered that they could distinguish nothing
more than was always to be heard at such
times.</p>

<p>"We are close to the camp of the Wyandots,"
was the alarming information.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" inquired his
friend.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot heard them," was the explanation,
in such a guarded undertone that his companions
barely caught his words.</p>

<p>No one thought of doubting the assertion of the
Indian, incredible as it sounded, and the truth of
his declaration was soon manifest. Certain as he
was that they were close to a party of his own
race, the advance was made with greater care than
before.</p>

<p>He picked his way with such patience and slowness
that Blossom found plenty of time in which
to lift his feet as high as he knew how, setting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
them down as though afraid of waking a slumbering
baby near at hand.</p>

<p>Within two rods of the spot where they halted
they suddenly caught the starlike twinkle of a
point of fire directly ahead. Instantly all stopped,
and no one spoke; they knew that it was the camp-fire
of the party whose presence the Shawanoe
learned a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Nothing more than the glimmer of the light
could be seen, because there were so many trees
and so much vegetation intervening.</p>

<p>"Let my brothers wait till I return," said Deerfoot,
turning his head so as not to speak too loud.</p>

<p>"It shall be done," replied Ned Preston, who
was on the point of asking a question, when he became
aware that he and Blossom were alone: Deerfoot
had vanished with the silence of a shadow.</p>

<p>"If we've to wait yar a long time," said Blossom
in a husky whisper, "we might as well sot
down."</p>

<p>Preston made no objection to this on the part of
his servant, but he remained standing himself,
leaning against a tree, while Blossom supported
his head in the same way.</p>

<p>"I don't care if Deerfoot doesn't come back for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
a week," remarked the negro lad, with a sigh of
contentment that at last he was permitted to rest
his limbs.</p>

<p>"He will not stay long," said Ned; "and the
best thing we can do while he is away is to do
nothing."</p>

<p>"Dat's just what I'm doin' as hard as I can."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't even speak, Blossom, for some of
the Indians may be near us."</p>

<p>"Dat suits me jes' as well," assented the other,
who thereafter held his peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Deerfoot the Shawanoe approached
the camp-fire of the Indians with all the care and
skill he could command. Possibly he would have
incurred no great risk by stalking boldly forward,
for he was already known among the tribe, which
was an ally of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>But the incident of the afternoon had taught
him a lesson, and he knew such a course would
deepen the suspicion which some of the Wyandots
already held against him.</p>

<p>They had given him to understand they were on
their way to reconnoiter Wild Oaks and some of
the settlements along the Ohio. If they should
find he was dogging them, what other proof could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
they ask that he was playing the part of spy
and enemy?</p>

<p>For this reason the Shawanoe determined to
avoid observation, and to make his reconnoissance
precisely as though he were an avowed foe of those
of his own race.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he gained a full view
of the camp. That which immediately caught his
attention and increased his misgiving was the fact
that this was a new party altogether. Waughtauk
did not lead these warriors, none of whom
was with the company whom the young scout
encountered during the afternoon.</p>

<p>But several other important facts were significant:
these were also Wyandots; they numbered
thirteen, and they were in their war-paint. They
had probably left their towns north of the Ohio
at the same time with Waughtauk, and they had
separated, the better to carry out some project the
chief had in view.</p>

<p>Shrewd and sagacious beyond his years as was
the Shawanoe, he was in a situation in which he
was compelled to do no little guessing. He was
satisfied that the chief and his warriors intended
to compass the destruction of the block-house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
sometimes known as Fort Bridgman, and to massacre
every one within it.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, like the Shawanoes, were brave
fighters, and why they had not assailed the post
was hard to tell, when it would seem they numbered
enough to overwhelm the garrison. It looked
as if Colonel Preston had discovered his danger,
though it was not an uncommon thing for a war
party to delay their attack on a station a long time
after it seemed doomed beyond all hope.</p>

<p>The Wyandots had disposed themselves in a
fashion that looked as though they meant to stay
where they were through the night. They had evidently
finished a meal on something, and were now
smoking their pipes, lolling on their blankets,
sharpening their knives with peculiar whetstones,
cleaning their guns, now and then exchanging a
few guttural words, the meaning of which not even
the sharp-eared Shawanoe could catch.</p>

<p>"They mean to attack the block-house," was
the conclusion of Deerfoot, who tarried only a few
minutes, when he began a cautious return to his
two friends, who were found as he had left them,
except that Blossom Brown was on the verge of
slumber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>Deerfoot quickly explained what he had learned,
and added that the difficulty of entering the block-house
was increased; but he believed, by acting
promptly, it could be done with safety. Ned Preston
was inclined to ask wherein the use lay of all
three going thither, when one would do as well,
and the obstacles were much greater than in the
case of a single person.</p>

<p>But the course of the guide convinced Preston
that he had some plan which he had not yet revealed,
and which necessitated the entrance of the
young pioneer at least into the block-house.</p>

<p>"Have you any knowledge when the Wyandots
will attack Colonel Preston?"</p>

<p>"The break of day is a favorite hour with Deerfoot's
people, but they often take other seasons."</p>

<p>"Why are they not closer to the station?"</p>

<p>"They are already close; we are within three
hundred yards of the fort; Deerfoot will lead the
way, and if the warriors' eyes are not like those of
the owl, we may pass through the gate before the
first sign of light in the east."</p>

<p>There was no necessity of telling Ned and Blossom
that their caution must not be relaxed a
single moment: no one could know better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
they that the briefest forgetfulness was likely to
prove fatal, for the Wyandots were all around them.
The detection of either lad would seal his fate.</p>

<p>The purpose of Deerfoot was to steal nigh
enough to the block-house to apprise the inmates
that they were on the outside, and awaiting an
opportunity to enter. Could they succeed in letting
Colonel Preston know the truth, all three
could be admitted in the darkness, with little
danger to themselves or to the garrison.</p>

<p>What the Shawanoe feared was that the Wyandots
had established a cordon, as it might be termed,
around the block-house. It was more than probable
that Colonel Preston had discovered the
approach of the hostiles in time to make quite
thorough preparations.</p>

<p>While this might not avert the attack of the red
men, it was certain to delay it. The next most
natural proceeding for the commandant would be
to dispatch a messenger to Wild Oaks, to inform
the settlers of his peril, and to bring back help.
The assailing Indians would anticipate such a
movement by surrounding the block-house so
closely that the most skillful ranger would find
it impossible to make his way through the lines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>If such were the case, it followed as a corollary
that no friend of the garrison would be able to
steal through the cordon and secure entrance into
the building: the gauntlet, in the latter case,
would be more difficult than in the former, inasmuch
as it would be necessary first to open communication
with Colonel Preston, and to establish
a perfect understanding before the task could be
attempted.</p>

<p>Deerfoot turned to the right, so as to pass around
the camp-fire, but his advance was with a caution
which can hardly be pictured. Ned Preston could
not hear the slightest sound, and where the darkness
was so deep it was hard work to keep informed
of his movements.</p>

<p>When the Shawanoe stopped, he merely
reached his hand back and touched Ned, who
did the same to Blossom; when the start was
made again, a slight sibilant sound, which a listening
Indian twenty feet distant would not have noticed,
told the fact. No one ventured to speak,
even in the most guarded whisper.</p>

<p>Had Deerfoot been alone, he would have advanced
much faster; but he gave his companions
time to raise their feet and put them down again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
with such slowness and care that not a leaf was
overturned.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown did much better than Preston
anticipated. The lad understood the need of
this elaborate caution, and as he had the two in
front of him, there was no excuse for his making
a false step. Once he began a sentence in a
husky whisper, but before it was half finished his
young master gripped him by the shoulder, as if
with an iron vise, and the attempt was not repeated.</p>

<p>After a time, which seemed almost interminable,
the camp-fire was flanked, though still in sight.
The situation of the three, as a consequence, became
more delicate and perilous than before; for,
to effect a safe withdrawal from the neighborhood,
they would have to pass through the lines again,
while there could be no doubt "the woods were
full" of other warriors.</p>

<p>Suddenly the serpent-like hiss of the Shawanoe
sounded, and all three came to a stand-still. This
was scarcely done when Deerfoot, for the first
time since the reconnoissance proper began,
broke silence by exclaiming, in a voice just audible,</p>

<p>"<i>Stoop down!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>His order was obeyed (for his companions knew
the danger was imminent) without a word or a
second's hesitation.</p>

<p>Their senses were on the alert, but for a minute
or two they neither heard nor saw anything to explain
the cause of the alarm of their guide. At the
end of the brief spell, a faint rustling was noticed
near them, and the listeners held their very breath.</p>

<p>This disturbance of the leaves must have been
caused by the feet of Wyandot warriors, who were
altogether closer than was comfortable for the lads
crouching on the ground. In the gloom, deepened
by the shadow of the wood, it was impossible
to see a half dozen feet; but while Ned Preston
was peering through the darkness in the direction
whence came the noise, a figure suddenly passed
across the field of vision between him and the
camp-fire.</p>

<p>Looking in the latter direction, he could see
something moving before the light. That which
arrested the attention of Ned was the head and
shoulders of an Indian warrior, who was gliding
with a silence which led the spectator to suspect
at first he was deceived. But the contour of the
scalp-lock, shoulders and chest was unmistakable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>The first had scarcely vanished, when a second
and a third followed in precisely the same fashion;
but though the eye strained itself to catch sight of
more, none appeared. The three were all who
came so near detecting the boys.</p>

<p>Ned Preston and Blossom Brown felt that the
perfect caution displayed by the Shawanoe was
more than repaid; for had it been less, the hostiles
would have learned their presence before they
themselves were detected.</p>

<p>All at once young Preston became aware that
Deerfoot was gone; he had quietly departed, as
was his custom, and would return when he saw fit.
Ned crept far enough backward to allow him to
whisper the fact to Blossom, without any risk of
being heard by other ears no matter how near
them.</p>

<p>A full half hour passed, when the Shawanoe
returned as silently as he had departed.</p>

<p>As Preston suspected, he had been off on a reconnoissance,
where he wanted no companions. He
announced the result in the alarming words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wyandots are everywhere; we cannot enter
the fort."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="s08">THE BLOCK-HOUSE.</span></h2>

<p>The block-house, known near a century ago as
Fort Bridgman, stood on the right bank of
the Licking river in Kentucky, and was some thirty
odd miles southwest of the present city of Maysville.</p>

<p>The block-house proper was a substantial structure
of heavy logs, and consisted of only two rooms&mdash;one
above and below. The lower story was a
dozen yards square, and the upper was two feet
greater in each direction, for the builders followed
the frontier fashion of projecting the second story
over the first. This projection being pierced with
portholes, gave opportunity to the garrison to fire
down on the heads of their assailants, who might
attempt to batter down the door, or make a rush
for the interior.</p>

<p>The roof was so steeply shelving that the most
agile Indian could not sustain himself on it. On
each side was a trap-door, intended for use in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
emergency. The roof itself was composed of thick
slabs of oak, and, like the logs, doors, and every
portion of the building, was bullet-proof.</p>

<p>The structure stood at the angle of a square of
one hundred feet, which was inclosed by a strong
stockade. This consisted of logs split through the
middle, one end sharpened and driven deep into
the earth, leaving the upper portions, which were
of irregular height, nine or ten feet above the
ground.</p>

<p>Standing at the angle of this square, it will be
seen that the block-house formed a part of two
sides. On that which faced the Licking was a
door and one window; on the opposite side, which
opened into the stockade or inclosure, were also a
door and window. On the other two sides were
two windows, but no door; the former were so narrow
that no Indian warrior could force his way
through them, while the doors of puncheon slabs
would have resisted for a long time the pounding
of a battering-ram. The windows were all on the
ground floor.</p>

<p>The fort having been built expressly for defensive
purposes, where the peril was known to be
great, it lacked nothing which the rude frontier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
warfare could suggest. It was so abundantly
pierced with loop-holes that the garrison commanded
every approach.</p>

<p>If the red men attempted to scale the stockade
at any point, they had to expose themselves to the
bullets of the unerring Kentuckians behind the
logs; while, if they secured a closer approach on in
the darkness of night, the defenders could shoot
them through the loopholes in the projecting floor
above.</p>

<p>There was a gate on each side of the stockade,
except on that furthest removed from the block-house.
Only one of these was used, and that was
on the southern side. The wooden chimney was
at the corner, entirely within the stockade, and the
numerous attacks which the structure had repelled
proved, more than anything else, the strength and
power of resistance of the defence.</p>

<p>The interior of the fort, as some called it, was
of the most primitive character. Below was a
rough slab floor, with a fireplace, the smoke from
which found its vent up the wooden chimney.
There were a bench, a table, and several rude
chairs, while a barrel of corn-meal was generally
kept pretty well filled against the emergency which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
all felt was liable to arise without an hour's
notice.</p>

<p>The second story, although larger, as we have
already stated, was furnished with the same simplicity.
It was supposed that, in case of danger,
this floor would be used more than the other by
the defenders. It had the two trap-doors in the
steep roof, and was liberally ventilated by means
of the numerous loopholes which let in bars of
light from every direction, and permitted the outlook
to take in as extensive a vision as though
the spectator was not surrounded by any walls at
all.</p>

<p>Fort Bridgman faced the Licking river on the
west, the stockade extending eastward. It was
originally intended to embrace the six cabins which
were put up by the settlers, but these were finally
left outside, and the inclosed square looked like a
small parade-ground, to be used for the benefit of
the garrison. It contained near the centre a well,
to be appealed to in emergency, though it was not
placed within the building itself, so as to shut off
the possibility of its being seized by an attacking
force. Colonel Preston more than once had expressed
a purpose to have such a well dug, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
was deferred from time to time until, as is generally
the case, the necessity was forgotten altogether.</p>

<p>In the roomy upper story of the block-house was
always kept a barrel of water, blankets, a few
chairs, a number of axes, shovels, spades, picks,
and utensils useful in a new settlement. Fort
Bridgman at one time promised to become an
important town in Kentucky; but a fierce raid by
a band of red men, one tempestuous night in mid-winter,
destroyed every cabin except the block-house,
in which only a few settlers found safe
refuge from the vengeful warriors.</p>

<p>In the autumn of which we are speaking there
were only two cabins beside the defence. These
stood outside the stockade, and one was occupied
by Colonel Hugh Preston, his wife Maria, and his
two daughters&mdash;Mary, aged ten, and Susie, eight
years old.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, an old Indian fighter of the early
days in Kentucky, made his home with the family,
while Jim Turner and Sam Megill occupied the
other. The last two were brothers-in-law, and it
was the intention of the latter to bring his wife
and three children from Wild Oaks in the spring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
live in the dwelling which he had taken so much
pains to erect and fit for their coming.</p>

<p>Such was the garrison of the block-house in the
autumn when Colonel Preston, while hunting in
the woods, learned of the presence of a war party
of Wyandots. It was by a pure accident, or rather
providence, that he discovered the alarming fact,
and he lost not a moment in improving the important
knowledge.</p>

<p>He hastened home, and the settlers gathered in
the block-house, with such extra provisions, blankets,
fuel, and other necessaries as they could get
together. The doors of the building and the gates
of the stockade were fastened, and the men stationed
themselves in the most available points to
detect the approach of their enemies.</p>

<p>The little garrison were none too soon in these
preparations, for within the succeeding half hour
the Wyandots were seen on the edge of the woods,
and creeping along the bank of the Licking one
hundred yards away. They were quick to note
that, with all their secrecy of movement, their
approach had been discovered; if they had any
doubts on the point, they were removed by a
couple of rifle-shots that were sent hurtling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
among the bushes which partly concealed their
bodies.</p>

<p>"It's a great disappointment to them," said Jo
Stinger, as he peered through a loophole, "for
they had every reason to believe we would be surprised."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be so much of a disappointment
that they will postpone the siege," remarked the
Colonel.</p>

<p>The old hunter shook his head, and added&mdash;</p>

<p>"That depends very much on how many redskins
are out there. If the party is not very large,
they will be apt to give it up; but if there are as
many as I fear, the varmints will hang on, in the
hope of cleanin' us out."</p>

<p>"They will have no easy task to do that," remarked
the Colonel, with a flash of the eye; "this
isn't the first time it has been tried, and it won't
be the first time it has failed."</p>

<p>"Suppose it is a success?" said his wife gently.</p>

<p>The Colonel turned when he heard the familiar
voice at his elbow, and, as he noticed Mary and
Susie playing on the floor, something like a pang
went to his heart. The sight caused him to feel
more vividly than ever before the dreadful meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of the word "failure," which had just passed
the lips of his beloved wife.</p>

<p>"Failure!" he repeated, as he placed his arm
affectionately on her shoulder; "do you regard it
possible, when I have <i>you</i> and the little ones depending
on us?"</p>

<p>"I know every man, and myself as well, will
fight to the end, but even that does not always
avail: the bravest must succumb when the assailants
overwhelm them."</p>

<p>Tears glistened in her eyes, as she tried hard to
look courageous, but a mother lives in her affections,
and no one could have felt more deeply than
did she, that all she valued in the world was at
that moment within the wooden walls of the
block-house, while a merciless foe was on the outside,
as eager as so many jungle tigers to reach
them.</p>

<p>"We have an abundance of ammunition,"
added the husband, seeking to hide a vague fear
which was creeping over him; "and we can stand
a longer siege than the Indians will care to maintain
against us."</p>

<p>"I trust so, but I cannot feel the hope which
sustains you: I wish you would send word to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
brother at Wild Oaks, that he may give us help
before it is too late."</p>

<p>This plan, although not named until now, was
in the minds of more than one member of the
garrison. Colonel Preston had asked himself
whether it was not the prudent thing to do, and
he looked at Jo Stinger to learn what he thought
of it.</p>

<p>The old scout nodded his head in a way to
signify he was favorable, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's the right thing, Colonel, and I'm the man
to do it."</p>

<p>"But how can you get out? The Indians will
be on the watch, and we are too few in number to
spare a man."</p>

<p>"Didn't I carry the news to Wild Oaks two
years ago, when it looked as though all of us was
going under sure?"</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;that's a fact; but was the risk as
great as now?"</p>

<p>"I think this is no greater, and it may not be
as great: that's to be found out. That time, I
took three hours to get through the red skin lines;
but when I had shook 'em clear, I done some of the
tallest traveling of my life."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"If you think it best, you may try it after
dark."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said the settler, with a compression
of the lips which showed his earnestness. He had
perilled his life many a time during the years spent
on the frontier, and he was not the man to hesitate,
when duty called him.</p>

<p>It was now the middle of the afternoon of the
blustery autumn day which saw the approach of
Ned Preston, Blossom Brown and the Shawanoe,
Deerfoot, to the vicinity of the block-house. The
garrison were sure to use the utmost vigilance
until the all-important question was settled, and
it was not probable the besieging Wyandots would
make any serious attack before the night was well
advanced.</p>

<p>When Megill, a tall, sinewy, iron-limbed pioneer,
learned the intention of Stinger to make the
attempt to reach Wild Oaks with a view of bringing
help, he commended the plan and said he
would gladly take his place. But Stinger would
not consent, and it was understood that the dangerous
task was to be undertaken by him who
proposed it.</p>

<p>As the chilly night settled over river, forest and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
clearing, every one in the block-house was impressed
with the solemnity of the situation. Even
little Mary and Susie talked in hushed voices of
the wicked Indians on the outside, and wondered
why they wished to harm those who had never
harmed them. When they knelt at their mother's
knee, their prayers were touching in their earnestness
and simple faith, and brought tears to the
eyes of their parents.</p>

<p>"God will take care of us," said Mary to the
elder, with the trusting belief of childhood; "so
don't feel bad, papa and mamma."</p>

<p>The mother had made them a bed in the corner,
beyond the reach of any stray bullets that might
find their way through the loopholes; and, as she
tucked the blankets around them and kissed them
good-night, she added her own petition to heaven
that it would guard and shield them from all
harm.</p>

<p>Stinger, Megill and Turner were at the loopholes;
and, while the twilight was deepening
within the gloomy block-house, Colonel Preston
lingered a few minutes beside his wife, who was
seated on a rude stool waiting for the little ones
to close their eyes in slumber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should we feel alarmed, Maria," he
asked, "when, as I told you a short time ago, we
have plenty of ammunition and the means to defend
ourselves? There are five rifles, one for each of
us, including yourself; these walls are too strong
to be battered down, and we can make our aim too
sure for the Wyandots to expose themselves long
to it."</p>

<p>"That is all true, Hugh, and I hope that
nothing I have said will cause misgiving on your
part; but, at the best, there are only a very, <i>very</i>
few of us, and you know accidents may happen:
suppose," she added in a tremulous voice, "one
or two of you should fall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel, begging pardon," interrupted Jo
Stinger, at this moment advancing toward them,
"you obsarve it's so dark inside that we couldn't
see each other's faces if it wasn't for that taller
candle burning on the stand, and I don't know of
a better time to start for Wild Oaks."</p>

<p>"Is it fully dark on the outside?" asked the
Colonel, glad of excuse to end the gloomy conversation.</p>

<p>"As dark as a wolf's mouth&mdash;so dark that I'm
hopeful of getting through the lines, without any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
bother; you know that every hour counts, and I
shall have to put in some big licks to reach Wild
Oaks and bring the boys here by to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>There could be no disputing this fact, and
Colonel Preston peeped through the loopholes,
first on one side of the block-house and then on
the other, until he had looked toward each point
of the compass.</p>

<p>It may be said that nothing but blank darkness
met his eye. He could hear the sound of the
flowing river, the solemn sighing of the night-wind
among the trees, but nowhere could he
catch the glimmer of the Indian camp-fire, nor
hear the red man's war-whoop which had fallen on
his ear more than once since he made his home on
the Dark and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>This impressive stillness told as eloquently of
the presence of the red man as the sounds of conflict
could have done.</p>

<p>"There is no need of waiting longer," remarked
the Colonel.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he began descending the ladder,
which answered for the stairs, Stinger following
him. On the lower floor there was not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
slightest ray of light, but both were so familiar
with the room that they needed no lamp.</p>

<p>Reaching the door, Colonel Preston placed his
hand on the heavy bars which held it in place, and
the two listened for several minutes. Nothing was
heard, and the fastenings were drawn with much
care and in almost complete silence.</p>

<p>"If you have to come back," whispered the
commandant, "give the signal and I will let
you in."</p>

<p>"I'll do so;&mdash;good bye," and, without any
more words, the scout vanished in the gloom.</p>

<p>To the consternation of Colonel Preston, he
heard the familiar whistle of Stinger a couple of
hours later, at which time he hoped he was well
on his way to Wild Oaks.</p>

<p>The messenger was safely admitted within the
block-house shortly after, and his first words
were&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's no use, Colonel; a rabbit couldn't creep
through the lines, they're watching so close."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="s08">THE MESSAGE.</span></h2>

<p>The declaration of Deerfoot the Shawanoe and
of Stinger the scout that the Wyandots were
holding such strict watch of the approaches to
the block-house that no one could leave or approach
it, was proof of the thoroughness of their
precautions. It showed still further that the red
men had determined to slay every one within the
building.</p>

<p>The first requisite to the success of such a
scheme was to prevent any one going to their help.
The assailants knew just how many people composed
the garrison; and, though the provisions
might last for days and possibly weeks, yet the
end must come sooner or later, when they would
lose the power of resistance from very exhaustion.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, with all the skill he could command,
conducted his two companions to a point along
the river bank nearly in front of the block-house.
This attained, he gave them to understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
they were in a very dangerous position, and it was
necessary to keep carefully hidden from the Wyandots.</p>

<p>Having gone thus far, it would seem that the
subtle Shawanoe ought to have gone further and
secured entrance into the block-house itself. Had
Colonel Preston known the exact situation, this
could have been done, as in the case of the scout
Stinger; but it was necessary first that a perfect
understanding should be established. There were
Wyandots everywhere: the watchful Shawanoe
heard them moving stealthily hither and thither,
and any one less skilful than he would have
brought on a collision long before.</p>

<p>Any act, signal or communication which would
apprise Colonel Preston of the truth, would attract
the notice of the watchful red men themselves; so
it would seem that Deerfoot had all his pains for
nothing. But we shall show that the remarkable
Shawanoe youth had not reached the end of his
rope by any means.</p>

<p>A question has doubtless presented itself to the
reader as to the necessity of the lads entering the
block-house at all. Inasmuch as Stinger wished
to get out, and they wished to get in, they might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
as well have exchanged positions. Deerfoot could
turn about and hasten to Wild Oaks with news
of the danger of the little garrison, leaving all the
men to defend it until assistance arrived.</p>

<p>But, as afterwards became known, Deerfoot was
following a special plan of his own. He was quick
to discover that Colonel Preston knew his peril
and would therefore do his utmost to defend the
post; but the wily Shawanoe, from what he had
learned, believed that the force of assailants was
so numerous and strong, that they were able to
carry the post before help could reach it from Wild
Oaks. In his estimation, the all-important thing
was to get re-inforcements into the block-house
without an hour's unnecessary delay: that done,
the time would then come for application to their
friends on the Ohio.</p>

<p>If Ned Preston and Blossom Brown could be
safely passed through the door, there would be
two guns added to the five within, and such an
addition was likely to prove the "balance of
power," that would save the garrison from destruction.</p>

<p>This was the belief of the Shawanoe, and, though
he did not explain his purpose at first, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
none the less determined that Colonel Preston
should receive the benefit of these two guns,
before application was made to his brother.</p>

<p>Between the block-house and Licking river was
a cleared space of one hundred yards, the cultivated
ground on every hand being so extensive
that the stockade could not be approached by any
foe unseen, except at night. The banks of the
Licking were from four to six feet above the
surface, while along the eastern shore, in front of
the block-house, was a fringe of bushes and
undergrowth, which offered a tempting hiding-place
to a foe.</p>

<p>It was natural to expect the Wyandots to make
use of this place, and they had done so, but they
already commanded the situation.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had one important advantage in the
fact that the Wyandots held no suspicion of the
presence of any friends of the whites in the
vicinity of the block-house, and consequently they
were not searching for such allies.</p>

<p>But it was easy to lose this ground, and he
convinced his companions that if it should be
found impossible to join Colonel Preston, it
would be equally fatal to attempt to leave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
neighborhood before night: detection was inevitable.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when the sun rose
on the morning succeeding Jo Stinger's failure to
pass through the lines (which effort was made a
number of hours before Deerfoot and his friends
reached the spot). The sky had cleared, and there
was scarcely a cloud to obscure its light.</p>

<p>Peeping carefully out from among the bushes
and undergrowth, the boys saw the massive block-house
standing at the corner of the stockade,
grim, silent, and as forbidding as though no living
person was within. The heavy oaken door, the
huge logs, the narrow windows, the steeply shelving
roof, with one trap-door visible, the wooden
chimney, the numerous loopholes, the sides of the
stockade stretching away to the left from the
building itself: all these added to the gloom and
tomb-like appearance of the structure.</p>

<p>Not a person could be seen, as a matter of
course, nor was any sound heard from the interior;
but while the three were stealthily studying the
building, they observed a faint, steely blue smoke
creeping upward from the wooden chimney. Mrs.
Preston had doubtless kindled a fire on the hearth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in the lower story, for the comfort of her little
ones on this crisp autumn morning, or she was
preparing a meal for the garrison.</p>

<p>"If we were sure that door would be opened
on the instant," said young Preston, alluding to
the entrance of the block-house which confronted
them, "we could make a dash across the clearing
and get inside, before the Wyandots would suspect
what was going on."</p>

<p>Deerfoot nodded his head to signify that his
friend was right, but the problem remained as to
how Colonel Preston should be apprised of the
fact that his friends were waiting so near at hand
for a chance to join him.</p>

<p>These boys were huddled as closely together as
possible under the bank, where they were not likely
to be seen, because there was no special reason
for the Wyandots seeking the same hiding-place.</p>

<p>Having reached the spot through much tribulation,
as may be said, the friends were careful not
to throw away the advantage gained. They
stealthily peeped over the edge of the bank, and
their words were spoken in guarded undertones
that could not have been heard by any one within
twenty feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"I's got the idee," said Blossom Brown, thrusting
forward his dusky countenance all aglow with
pleasure: "I know jes' how we can tell de Colonel
we're out yar, without de Injines knowing a thing
about it."</p>

<p>"How would my brother with the face of the
night do?" asked the Shawanoe, turning toward him.</p>

<p>"I'll jes' gib a lot ob hoots like a big owl dat
am scared, and de Colonel will know it's me,
'cause de last time I war at de block-house I done
it to please de little gals, Mary and Susie."</p>

<p>"That will never do," Ned Preston hastened to
say; "for the Wyandots would suspect the truth
the instant they heard your hooting, and it
wouldn't be long before they called on us."</p>

<p>"Den," added the African, who seemed to think
the responsibility of settling the question rested
with him, "let's jes' set up a yellin' dat de Colonel
will hear, and make a rush for de house: he'll
know we're comin' and will slip down and open de
door, or, if he don't, we can climb ober de fence
and run round de back way."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe did not consider the proposals of
Blossom worthy of notice, though they were made
in all seriousness. Looking at Ned, he asked&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>"Will my brother let Deerfoot see one of his
letters?"</p>

<p>Wondering at the meaning of this request, Preston
drew a missive from the inner pocket of his
coat and handed it to the Indian. It was written
on a large sheet of blue paper, the last page of
which was unruled, so as to permit the superscription,
for the ordinary envelope was unknown in
those days. The sheet was carefully folded and
doubled within itself, being sealed with a large red
wafer, and the name of Colonel Hugh Preston,
and the somewhat voluminous address, were
written in a large plain hand in ink of glossy
blackness.</p>

<p>It was the penmanship which excited the wonder
of the Shawanoe more than did anything on which
he had looked for many a day. He held the letter
in his hand, and, for several minutes, scrutinized
the writing with an interest that can hardly be
described. Through the paper his keen eyes
detected the faint tracery of some of the letters
inside. Balancing the missive edgewise, between
his thumb and forefinger, he gently pressed it
until it partly spread open, despite the seal. Then,
raising it before his face, he closed one eye as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
though he were aiming his arrow at something,
and peeped within.</p>

<p>The glimpse of the writing was as pleasing to
him as the sight of the circus is to the urchin who
creeps under the canvas; and, though he could
not decipher the meaning of a character, he
stared for several minutes, almost holding his
breath, as though he would force the secrets from
the "Rosetta stone."</p>

<p>He had heard of such things before, but it was
hard for his untutored mind to understand that
what a man had said to his friend was in that
little package, and when opened, it would speak
the same message to him. His feelings must have
been similar to those of his white brother, could
he have seen the telephone of to-day perform its
wonderful work.</p>

<p>"We write our words on the paper," said Ned,
hoping to help the mind of the youth grasp the
subject: "and when our friend gets the paper,
there are the words looking him in the face."</p>

<p>Deerfoot inclined his head, as though he understood
the explanation, but Ned saw that it was
like the assent of the school-boy who doesn't wish
his classmates to consider him stupid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>"If I should make a figure on the paper that
looked like a deer, and some one should take it
to you, and you looked at it, you would know that
it was meant for a deer, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded emphatically this time: he
clearly understood <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>"Suppose I should make some lines and characters
which you and I agreed beforehand should
mean, 'I am your friend and brother'; when those
lines and characters were brought to you on paper,
wouldn't you remember what they meant?"</p>

<p>The black eyes of Deerfoot sparkled. He had
caught, for the first time in his life, an inkling of
the mystery. He saw, as through a glass, darkly,
the achievements of the white man who could
forward his words hundreds of miles, hidden in a
small piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Will my brother teach Deerfoot how to send
his thoughts to the Great Spirit?"</p>

<p>There was a wistful expression in the dark eyes
of the Shawanoe, which touched Ned Preston.
The voice of the lad trembled, as he answered
impressively&mdash;</p>

<p>"You need no such means to reach the Great
Spirit, as you must have heard from your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
people: <i>our</i> Great Spirit is always looking down
in kindness on his children, and his ears are ever
open to hear what they have asked him."</p>

<p>"Will my white brother tell Deerfoot of the
Great Spirit of the pale faces, that the missionary
talks about?"</p>

<p>"I will be glad to do so, for it is what all of
your people should know; when we can gain the
time, I will teach you how to read books and write
letters just as well as any white man can do, for I
am sure that one who is so bright as you, will learn
it with much ease."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will never forget his pale-faced
brother," said the Shawanoe gratefully.</p>

<p>"And if masser Ned don't got de time, den I'll
jes' take you hummin' frough all de knowledge dat
you want," said Blossom with an exaggerated
idea of his importance.</p>

<p>"It would be well for you to learn how to read
and write yourself, before trying to teach others,"
said Preston.</p>

<p>"I reckon dar aint many dat can beat me
'round de settlements; I can spell 'dog' and
'cat'."</p>

<p>"Let's hear you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>"D-o-a-g, dog; r-a-t, cat&mdash;no, dat spells something
else,&mdash;I forget what, but I'm dar all de time,
jes' de same."</p>

<p>Deerfoot was still holding the letter in his hand
and looking earnestly at Ned, without noticing the
words of Blossom.</p>

<p>"Can my white brother write on the back of
this the words which Colonel Preston can read?"</p>

<p>It flashed upon young Preston that the keen-witted
youth was unraveling the plan he had held
in mind from the first.</p>

<p>"Certainly I can."</p>

<p>"Write some message on this paper for him."</p>

<p>"But, Deerfoot, I have no pen, nor ink, nor
pencil, or I would only be too glad to do so."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was prepared for this.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will bring you something that will
do."</p>

<p>He moved away from his young friends, with
that silence and stealth which seemed a part
of his nature, while the delighted and expectant
friend turned to Blossom Brown&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you understand what his plan is to reach&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned did not finish the question, for he saw that
his servant, despite the gravity of the situation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
and the crispness of the air, was lying on his side
sunk in a sound slumber. Fortunately his posture
was such an easy one that he did not breathe loud
enough to create any danger of being heard.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was gone only a few minutes,
when he reappeared holding in his hand a piece
of reddish brown stone, almost as soft as the
mineral known as "red chalk," and which he had
evidently broken from some crumbling rock.</p>

<p>Ned Preston carefully sharpened it to a point,
as though it were a lead-pencil. It could not be
said to work very well, when applied to paper, but
he found that patience and care would enable him
to write considerable that would be legible to any
one who understood writing.</p>

<p>Accordingly with much pains and labor he
traced the following lines, first consulting Deerfoot
as to what should be placed in the communication&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Uncle Hugh</span>:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, the friendly Shawanoe, Blossom
Brown, our servant, and I are along the bank
of the river, exactly opposite the front of the
block-house. We want to join you, so as to
help you fight off the Wyandots, but they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
so plenty all around us that we daresn't try it,
unless you are prepared to let us in the door,
the instant we reach it. When you are ready,
wave your hand through the front window, and
we'll make the start.</p>

<p class="left25">
"Your affectionate nephew,<br />
<span class="i10 smcap">"Ned."</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="s08">OPENING COMMUNICATION.</span></h2>

<p>Ned Preston read the note to Deerfoot, the
Shawanoe, speaking slowly and distinctly
each word, while the young Indian listened with
an expression of intense interest and pleasure.</p>

<p>"If the Colonel sees that, then will he read
those words you have spoken to me?"</p>

<p>"They will be the same."</p>

<p>"Then he shall see them."</p>

<p>As the young warrior spoke, he extended his
hand for the missive, which was given him. He
deftly drew an arrow from his quiver and began
tying the letter to the missile, doing it with much
care, for the task he was about to essay seemed an
almost impossible one.</p>

<p>"We are a hundred yards from the block-house,"
said Ned Preston; "it is a long shot for
the bow and arrow."</p>

<p>"Would my brother like to use his gun?"
asked Deerfoot with his shadowy smile, his question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
being intended to remind his friend of the
superiority of the primitive weapon over the rifle,
at least in such an emergency as the present.</p>

<p>"The gun is of no use just now," said Preston,
"and I mistrust that your bow will not serve you
as well as you think."</p>

<p>"You shall see," was the comment of the
owner, who gave his full attention to the task
before him. He used a shred of deer-sinew
and fastened the letter directly behind the iron
barb. That done, the faithful bow was carefully
strung, and then the youth bent himself to the
work.</p>

<p>His intention was to send the arrow, if possible,
through the narrow window to the left of the front
door of the block-house. This had no glass, nor
screen, but as it was no more than eight inches
wide, although three times as high, and as the
shaft was weighted with a foreign substance, likely
to affect its accuracy of flight, some idea of the
difficulty of the feat may be gained.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was necessary that the shot
should be fired secretly. Deerfoot had no opportunity
of standing out on the open ground, where his
limbs would be unimpeded, but he must aim from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
behind the bank, so that no vigilant Wyandot
would detect him.</p>

<p>He set to work, standing below the bank and
pointing between an intervening bush or two,
making sure, however, that an unobstructed path
was open for his arrow. The missile was pointed
at an elevation of fully forty-five degrees; and,
with one eye closed, he slowly drew back the
string until the head touched the right hand,
which grasped the middle of the bow.</p>

<p>It was held thus ten seconds, during which the
athlete was as rigid and motionless as if moulded
in iron, while his eye rested on the narrow slit-like
window cut in the solid logs, all of a hundred
yards away.</p>

<p>Ned Preston kept his gaze fixed on the Indian,
who at that moment formed a picture worthy of
the finest artist that ever touched brush to
canvas.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a faint twang, the bow
straightened out like lightning, and the arrowy
messenger started on its path weighted with the
all-important message.</p>

<p>Preston instantly glanced at the block-house,
centering his eye on the straight opening, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
with scarcely a hope that Deerfoot could succeed
in what would certainly be a marvelous exploit.</p>

<p>As the arrow was speeding directly away from
the lads, it was impossible to distinguish its
course through the air, though it could have been
seen easily, had they been stationed at right angles
to its line of flight.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, having discharged the weapon,
immediately lowered it, and then peered forward to
learn the result of his shot.</p>

<p>But Preston had scarcely time to fix his gaze on
the distant window, when he saw something like
the flutter of a shadow&mdash;so to speak&mdash;directly in
the opening itself. It came and went with the
quickness of a flash, and he could not define it.</p>

<p>But where was the arrow?</p>

<p>It vanished from sight the instant it left the
bowstring, and Ned had not seen it since. It
should have struck somewhere in a very few
seconds, but had the head buried itself in the
ground between the river and the block-house, the
eagle-feather would have been visible. Had it
fallen on the roof, its sharp point would have held
the shaft motionless.</p>

<p>"You must have sent it over the block-house,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
said Ned, turning to Deerfoot; "and in that
case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for the same shadowy smile on the
handsome face of the young Shawanoe told the
truth: the arrow had gone directly through the
window, and the curious fluttering shadow which
caught the eye of Preston was the missile with its
message.</p>

<p>"That is the most wonderful shot I ever saw!"
exclaimed Ned in a burst of admiration; "if I
could use the bow as you do, I never would touch
a gun. But, Deerfoot, is there not danger that
some of the Wyandots saw the arrow in its
flight?"</p>

<p>"If they were looking across the clearing, they
saw it perhaps; but Deerfoot hopes they did not."</p>

<p>"Suppose you had missed the window,&mdash;that
the arrow had struck the roof, or the ground, or
the logs at the side of the opening, it would have
buried its head and stayed in plain sight, would it
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the Wyandots would be certain to
see it."</p>

<p>"And would soon know where it came from?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could have prevented."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed Ned; "you ran a
great risk."</p>

<p>"We did; there was no way to prevent it."</p>

<p>Ned was almost speechless, when he realized
how much had depended on the success of the
shot of the Shawanoe: in fact, had he known all,
he never would have consented that the task
should have been attempted.</p>

<p>Had the arrow gone a few inches to the right
or left, or had it fallen short, or flown too high, the
Wyandots would have swooped down on the archer
and his friends, before they could have left the
spot.</p>

<p>Ned Preston regarded the shot as amazing as
the mythical one made by William Tell; and, but
for the urgency of the danger, would have given
further expression to his admiration. Deerfoot
himself was somewhat uneasy, and, for several
minutes, glanced right and left, and through the
undergrowth for signs of danger; but nothing
appeared, and it looked as though a piece of
extremely good fortune had attended the remarkable
exploit.</p>

<p>Such being the case, Preston now devoted his
attention to the window, from which he expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
to see the hand of his uncle, Colonel Preston,
waving in friendly signal for them to make the
desperate run across the clearing.</p>

<p>While he was thus employed, the keener vision
of the Shawanoe was roaming over the open space,
each side of the stockade, the woods beyond, and
especially did he scrutinize the two deserted
cabins that stood to the right.</p>

<p>The visual search had not continued long, when
it was rewarded by the unwelcome discovery that
in the building nearest him were several Wyandots,
who had probably spent the night there.
He saw their heads and shoulders, as they passed
the windows where they were beyond sight of the
garrison, but were in plain view of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>This cabin was much nearer the block-house
than were the boys, from which the daring nature
of the project will be understood. Deerfoot was
hopeful before this that the houses were clear of
Wyandots, in which event his friends would have
had a much better prospect of success.</p>

<p>As it was, it all depended on how complete the
surprise could be made for the red men. If they
failed to note the running youths until the block-house
was nearly reached, they would be too late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
to head them off, except by a shot from their
guns, and this risk could not be avoided under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>"<i>There it is!</i>"</p>

<p>It was Ned Preston who uttered the exclamation
in such excitement that his voice was dangerously
high.</p>

<p>"Sh! not so loud!" whispered Deerfoot,
scrutinizing the window through which he sent
his arrow a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was right: the hand of a person
was thrust through the opening and waved several
times. It swayed back and forth, and up and
down, with much deliberation, as though the
owner was fearful it would not be observed by his
friends along the river bank.</p>

<p>More than that, Deerfoot was sure he saw the
face of the one who signalled them, though the
distance was such that nothing like a recognition
took place.</p>

<p>After withdrawing his hand, it was put forth
again, and the motion was repeated. Colonel
Preston evidently meant that, if any mistake was
made, it should not be his fault.</p>

<p>Ned Preston now carefully awakened Blossom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Brown and explained what had been done and
what was contemplated.</p>

<p>"You have got to run as you never ran before,"
said his master, "and when you have once started,
there is no turning back."</p>

<p>"What would I want to turn back for?" was
the wondering question of the African.</p>

<p>"You might think it better to stay where
we are, and it may be that it is; but after the
Wyandots learn we are here, it is run or die
with us."</p>

<p>"My brother speaks the truth," said Deerfoot,
who was looking across the clearing at the nearest
cabin: "there are red men there, and they will
try and hinder you from reaching your friends."</p>

<p>There was no reason to hope the prospect would
improve by waiting, and it was decided to start at
once. Deerfoot, it was understood, was to remain
where he was and to make no attempt for the
present to enter the block-house. It was expected
that, after Blossom and Ned were safely within the
building, the guide would hasten to Wild Oaks
and bring assistance to the beleaguered garrison.</p>

<p>When the boys were ready, the Shawanoe impressed
one fact upon them: they were not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
cease running for an instant, unless stopped
beyond all power to overcome, but, fixing their
eyes on the door of the block-house, strain every
nerve to reach the goal.</p>

<p>Each lad was to carry his loaded gun in his
right hand, but not to use it, unless forced to do
so: if Colonel Preston should delay admitting
them, they would be lost; but there was no cause
to fear such a miscarriage.</p>

<p>The boys stealthily moved forward and up the
bank, and, pausing near the margin, awaited the
word from the Shawanoe. The perilous point, in
the eye of the latter, was the cabin where he knew
the Wyandots to be, and he watched it closely for
several minutes. Nothing was to be seen of them
just then, and he said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>On the instant, Ned Preston and Blossom
Brown bounded across the clearing in the direction
of the block-house: it was a straight run of a
hundred yards over a level piece of land, on which
only a few stumps remained to show that it was
once covered by the forest.</p>

<p>The African, it need not be said, strained every
nerve and fibre of his being to reach the goal. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
heavy, lumbering build made him less fleet than
Preston, who could have drawn away from the
beginning; but he could not desert his companion
in such extremity and he timed his speed, so as to
keep just ahead of Blossom, and thus urge him to
his utmost.</p>

<p>Crouching under the shelter of the river bank,
Deerfoot watched the run for life with the intensest
interest. He grasped his strong bow with his
right hand, while one of his arrows was held in
the left, ready to use on the instant it might
become necessary for the safety of either of the
fugitives.</p>

<p>Those who knew Deerfoot best, said he was
reluctant to employ his marvelous skill on any
person, and would not do so as long as it was safe
to refrain; but it would have required only a
single glance at his glittering eye and compressed
lips, to understand that he considered the emergency
was now at hand.</p>

<p>It so happened that the fugitives had gone no
more than ten yards on their swift run, when
the Wyandots in the cabin discovered them
and made known the fact in the most alarming
manner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>First several whoops broke the stillness within
the building, and then two sharp reports followed.
The Wyandots had fired, but their aim was so
hurried that, as it seemed to Deerfoot, neither of
the fugitives was harmed. At least they continued
their flight with unabated speed.</p>

<p>But the efforts of the Wyandots to check the
boys was not to end with the simple discharge of
their rifles. The two that had used their pieces,
sprang from the front windows of the cabin and
dashed quartering across the clearing, with the
intent to head off the youths, before they could
reach the block-house.</p>

<p>This brought both in range of the terrible bow
of Deerfoot who placed the arrow in position; but
it was his intention to hold the weapon until it
should become imperatively necessary to use it,
for it will be seen that, if he took part in the
singular contest, it would be such a complete
unveiling of his true character that his usefulness
to the whites would be almost destroyed.</p>

<p>Besides, each boy carried a loaded rifle which he
knew how to use, and it was not to be supposed
that either would allow himself to be tomahawked
or taken prisoner without resistance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>The Wyandots who ran forth in the effort to
throw themselves across the path of the fugitives,
were as daring warriors as ever mingled in the
fierce fight with settlers or those of their own
race. They had emptied their guns in the futile
effort to bring down the boys, and, throwing the
weapons aside, they now sprang forward with the
resolution to make them prisoners, despite the
risk to themselves, for they must have known that
the garrison would endeavor to protect their
friends, and they could not help suspecting that
there was one or more along the river bank, who
were likely to take part in the singular struggle.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the red men ran straight
from the deserted cabin across the path of the
boys, who found themselves confronted by the
brawny redskins, before they had gone half the
distance to the building.</p>

<p>"Let's sneak 'round ahind de block-house and
climb ober de fence and hide," said Blossom, when
he saw the gauntlet he had to run.</p>

<p>"Straight for the door!" commanded Preston:
"that is our only chance!"</p>

<p>But the youth had scarcely spoken the words,
when he saw that a collision with the Wyandots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
was inevitable: they were between them and the
fort, and there was no possible way of flanking
them.</p>

<p>The superior fleetness of Ned held him slightly
in advance of his companion. The former ran
until close to the Wyandots, when he turned to
the left. The warriors immediately leaped forward
so that they were still directly in front of
the fugitives.</p>

<p>"It must be done!" exclaimed Ned, coming to
an instant halt, raising his rifle and aiming at the
nearest Indian, who was in the very act of poising
himself to throw his tomahawk.</p>

<p>Everything passed so swiftly that the spectators
could scarcely follow the movements. At the
moment Ned drew his gun to position, he caught
the flash of the implement as it circled with
lightning quickness over the bronzed skull of his
enemy.</p>

<p>Young Preston knew what was coming. Pausing
only long enough to catch the gleam of the
warrior's eyes, over the sights of his rifle, he
pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>The Indian aimed at the head of the youth
and drove the tomahawk with prodigious force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and unerring accuracy; but the blade of the
implement glanced against the barrel of the
rifle, sending out a streak of flame, and, with
a tremendous rebound or ricochet, shot by the
shoulder of the lad, touching the ground
fifty feet away, and rolling over and over several
times, before it lay still. When it left the hand
of the warrior, it was with a force that would have
cloven the skull of the lad, as though it were
cardboard.</p>

<p>The throw and miss were remarkable, but, by a
striking coincidence, the rifle of Ned Preston was
discharged at the second the two weapons collided.
The violent shock to the gun turned it
aside, and the ball buried itself harmlessly in the
ground, far to the right of the crouching Wyandot.</p>

<p>The latter saw by what a hair's-breadth he had
escaped, and snatching his hunting-knife from the
belt at his waist, he bounded toward the youth,
who, nothing daunted, recoiled a single step, and,
grasping his weapon by its barrel, awaited the
attack.</p>

<p>All this took place in a few seconds, during
which the other Wyandot, feeling that the dark-faced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
fugitive was his own, watched the extraordinary
conflict, with an interest as intense as
that of the other spectators further away.</p>

<p>Had the encounter between young Preston and
the sinewy Wyandot been permitted to go on,
there could have been but one result; but Deerfoot,
who was holding his breath, with his eyes
riveted on the combatants, now drew his arrow to
its head and aimed at the assailing warrior.</p>

<p>Although the distance between him and his
target was no more than half way across the
clearing, yet the feat was immeasurably more
difficult than that of sending the letter through
the narrow window; for, unfortunately, Ned Preston
and the Wyandot were standing so nearly in
a line that the young Shawanoe could only see the
head and shoulders of the powerful savage a few
feet beyond.</p>

<p>Beside this, the two were likely to change their
respective positions any instant: they might do so
indeed after the launching of the arrow, which
would not only miss the red man at whom it was
pointed, but was liable to strike the boy himself.</p>

<p>Even Deerfoot doubted his own success and he
therefore aimed with the greater care and caution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
slowly drawing back the shaft, and with nerves
like iron, looked steadily along the reed and at the
tableau far beyond.</p>

<p>But before the fingers let go the string, the
necessity for doing so vanished. The incidents
which we have undertaken to describe, passed
with such swiftness that it would have been
hard for a spectator to follow each phase, few as
they were; but it need not be said that every man
within the block-house was watching the extraordinary
scene on the clearing with an interest as
intense, as absorbing and breathless, as that of
Deerfoot himself.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston was standing by the door, with
one hand on the cumbersome latch, ready to draw
it inward the instant the boys reached the proper
point; while Jo Stinger, Jim Turner and Sam
Megill held their rifles ready to use, the very
second it should become necessary.</p>

<p>There was such bewildering rapidity in the
events narrated, that the spectators within the
block-house did not comprehend the extreme peril
of young Preston, until they saw the Wyandot
advancing on him with his drawn knife.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Jo Stinger, "it's the opinion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the undersigned that this is a good time of day to
fire off a gun."</p>

<p>"Quick!" called out Colonel Preston from
below, as he peeped through the door; "shoot
that Indian!"</p>

<p>"That's just what is contemplated," replied
Stinger, whose rifle was already thrust through a
loophole, while he was looking along the gleaming
barrel.</p>

<p>But, to the consternation of the veteran, the
moment he drew bead on the warrior, he discovered
he stood in such exact line with young
Preston that it was impossible to shoot the red
man without the absolute certainty of striking the
lad directly beyond.</p>

<p>"I've got to wait," called out Jo, by way of
explaining his inaction, "until they shift their
positions."</p>

<p>Had the vengeful Wyandot comprehended the
vast advantage he gained by holding the youth
directly in front, he would have continued to do
so; but it was almost impossible that he should
have been subtle enough to make such a discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ned Preston, daring, resolute and
defiant, grasped the barrel of his rifle, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
one foot thrown forward, and with the stock of his
gun flung back in the position, and with the pose
of a skilled batsman awaiting the pitching of a
ball, braced himself for the assault.</p>

<p>The Indian, powerful, active and alert, bent his
knees and back slightly, like a panther gathering
for a leap, and glared in the face of the youthful
David, who so calmly confronted the fierce Goliath.</p>

<p>It was a trying position for the boy, who looked
dauntlessly into the hideous countenance daubed
with ochre and paint. It was probably the truth
that the Wyandot was testing the power of his
eye, as the rattle-snake does with the bird. If
such were the case, the result could not have been
gratifying to the warrior.</p>

<p>All at once, without removing his eyes from
those of Ned, the Indian deftly extended his left
foot slightly forward and a brief distance to one
side. Then he gradually shifted the weight of
his body over upon it, until he had transferred
himself nearly a foot out of alignment.</p>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe instantly detected this,
and pointed his arrow with full confidence; Jo
Stinger was equally on the alert, and his keen gray
eye glanced along the barrel with more certainty;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
but, not unnaturally perhaps, the two marksmen,
from opposite standpoints, understood the peculiar
maneuvering which the Wyandot had begun: he
intended to circle slowly around the boy, who
stood on the defensive, watching for an opening,
which he would seize with the quickness of lightning.</p>

<p>If such should prove the fact, the spectators
had but a short while to wait: and such did prove
to be the fact.</p>

<p>Once more the Wyandot moved his left foot,
almost as far as the limb permitted, and held it
motionless, with the toe resting on the ground.
All the time his black eyes were fixed with burning
intensity on the youth, and his right hand
grasped the haft of the knife, as though he would
crush it to nothingness.</p>

<p>Ned Preston suspected the purpose of his
assailant and he instantly turned, so as to face
him, who had not such an easy task as might have
been supposed.</p>

<p>For a full minute, the left leg of the Wyandot
remained extended, with nothing but the toe of
the foot daintily touching, as though he meant to
draw a line upon the earth with it. Then his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
weight gracefully glided over upon the limb, the
gleaming eyes never once shifting from the pale
face of the boy pioneer.</p>

<p>Scarcely was this movement&mdash;slight as it was&mdash;completed,
when the oppressive stillness was
broken by the explosive report of a rifle, a blue
puff of smoke curled upward from one of the
loopholes of the block-house, and those who were
looking at the Wyandot, saw him suddenly throw
his hands above his head, walk rapidly and uncertainly
backward several steps, and then, with a
faint cry, fall, with limbs outstretched, stone-dead.</p>

<p>The second warrior became so absorbed in the
scene that he fixed his gaze on the two, paying no
heed to the African, who, he must have believed,
was at his mercy, when he chose to give his
attention to him.</p>

<p>With a shrewdness hardly to be expected, the
servant was quick to see that another's extremity
was his opportunity.</p>

<p>"Nobody aint tinkin' 'bout Wildblossom Brown
jes' now," was the belief of the lad, "which shows
dat it am a good time to tink 'bout hisself."</p>

<p>He immediately began what may be called a
flank movement around the three parties, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
took no notice of him, although Deerfoot and the
onlookers in the block-house observed the prudent
action of the lad. They were greatly relieved,
inasmuch as he could not offer the slightest help
by staying behind.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that, at the moment the
rifle was fired from the block-house, Blossom was
well on his way toward it, and his subsequent
action was like that of a runner who awaited the
report as a signal. At the very instant it broke
the stillness, he made a burst of speed and ran
with might and main straight for shelter. The
start that his own foresight had secured, placed
him so far in advance of his enemies that his
safety was virtually obtained.</p>

<p>"Open dat door!" he shouted in a voice that
must have been heard a half mile away; "open
her wide, or I'll smash her in!"</p>

<p>He plunged across the clearing like a steam-engine,
and the door was drawn inward, while he
was twenty paces distant, so that everything was
in his favor.</p>

<p>Without checking himself in the least he "took
a header" through the entrance and went clean
across the lower floor and against the opposite side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of the room, with a force that shook the entire
building.</p>

<p>"My gracious, Blossom, it was a narrow
escape!" exclaimed the Colonel, alluding to the
flight of the lad from the warrior who had marked
him for his own.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blossom; "I like to have knocked
my brains out agin de oder side de ole fort."</p>

<p>"I'm more afraid the block-house has been
injured than I am that you have suffered; but you
are safe now, and I can only hope that Ned may
be equally fortunate."</p>

<p>The address and courage displayed by the surviving
Wyandot aroused the admiration of the
garrison, for it far surpassed their expectation.</p>

<p>The very instant the first red man was struck,
and while he was staggering backwards, Ned
Preston started with might and main for the
sheltering block-house: he was thus quick to
adopt the only course that offered safety, for the
other warrior still held his knife and tomahawk at
command, and was more alert, cunning and brave
than the one that had fallen.</p>

<p>Young Preston's promptness gained him considerable
start, but he was no more than fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
under way, when the other made for him with the
speed of a deer. Ned was fleet for his years, but
he was no match for the pursuing warrior, who
gained rapidly.</p>

<p>The amazing daring of this pursuit can scarcely
be explained: the Wyandot was straining every
nerve to overtake the fugitive, who was striving
with equal desperation to reach the block-house
before him. The red man held his formidable tomahawk
in his right hand, and was running straight
toward the building from which the shot was fired,
and from which he must have known others were
certain to come. It was precisely as if a single
soldier should deliberately charge upon a masked
battery, of whose precise location he was well aware.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the Wyandot had not run
half the intervening distance, when another blue
puff, floating aside from the loophole, accompanied
the report of a rifle. Jim Turner had fired at the
approaching Wyandot, but he did it so hastily
that he missed him altogether.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i130" id="i130"></a>
<img src="images/i-130.jpg" width="550" height="396" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ned Makes a Narrow Escape.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"Is there no way of stopping him?" muttered
Sam Megill, hurriedly bringing his gun to bear
and discharging it; but, astonishing as it may
seem, he missed also.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>Jo Stinger was hastily reloading his piece,
determined that the daring red man should not
escape him, when Ned Preston dashed through
the door and was safe.</p>

<p>As the Colonel quickly shut and fastened the
entrance, a heavy thud was heard. The Wyandot
had hurled his tomahawk with such prodigious
force at the vanishing fugitive that the blade was
buried half way to its head, and the handle projecting
outward, would have required a power like
that of King Arthur to draw it forth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="s08">WITHIN THE BLOCK-HOUSE.</span></h2>

<p>Having hurled his tomahawk with such venomous
force at the vanishing fugitive, the
baffled Wyandot, for the first time, seemed to
think of his own safety.</p>

<p>The momentum of his furious pursuit carried
him almost against the door of the block-house
and directly beneath the overhanging floor, built so
as to allow the defenders to fire down on the heads
of their assailants. The rapid shifting of position
served to confuse the garrison to a certain extent,
but the action of the Indian was incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Making a sharp turn to the left, he ran with
astonishing swiftness along the front of the building
and stockade, until he was half way to the
north-western angle, around which he had only to
dart to be beyond reach of any bullet; but he
seemed to think all at once that he had made a
mistake. He stopped like a flash, turned with inconceivable
quickness, and sped directly over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
ground he had traversed, passing in front of the
stockade and the block-house, his evident purpose
being to reach the deserted cabin from which he
had emerged in the first place.</p>

<p>As he was running with tremendous speed
in front of the building, another gun was discharged
at him, but he showed no sign of being
harmed, and, without a second's hesitation, made
for the cabin, where a brother brave awaited him.</p>

<p>"I consider that that 'ere beats all creation!"
exclaimed Jo Stinger, aggravated over the repeated
escapes of the daring redskin; "all I want is a
chance to get a pop at him."</p>

<p>There was little time to spare, for the movements
of the Wyandot proved him to be no
ordinary athlete, and he was going for the open
window of the cabin, like the wind.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, by the utmost haste, beat him in
the novel contest, and, thrusting his gun hastily
through the loophole, aimed and fired with unusual
nervousness.</p>

<p>"I struck him!" he exclaimed in great glee,
as the warrior sprang in air, as if shot upward by
a catapult.</p>

<p>"You haven't harmed a hair of his head!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
laughed Jim Turner, who was peering through one
of the loopholes; "it wasn't your bullet that
made him jump."</p>

<p>"You're right," muttered the chagrined scout;
"if I had another gun, I would break this one to
pieces."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the fault of your <i>rifle</i>," was the
truthful remark of his companion.</p>

<p>At the very moment Jo Stinger took his hasty
aim and fired his gun, the fleeing Wyandot was so
near the cabin that he bounded upward from the
ground and went through the door, as the performer
in the circus bounds through the hoop
covered with paper.</p>

<p>The bullet which so rarely missed its mark did
so in this instance by a hair's-breadth; but under
such circumstances, a miss was as good as a mile,
and the courageous Wyandot plunged through the
entrance without a scratch, or so much as the
"smell of fire" about his garments.</p>

<p>He had played a most desperate game and won
so brilliantly that the veteran Jo Stinger, while
exasperated over his own failure, felt like cheering
the exploit.</p>

<p>The safety of the brave seemed to be the signal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
for a general fire along the lines. The Wyandots
began discharging their rifles from the wood
beyond the stockade, north, east and south, while
Deerfoot was somewhat alarmed to hear several
shots from the river bank where he was crouching,
and at no great distance from him.</p>

<p>A number crept up to the rear of the nearest
cabin, into which they entered without much
danger to themselves, and from the windows of
which they discharged their pieces at the block-house.
This seemed a useless expenditure of
ammunition, but there was a chance or two of
doing something. Some of the bullets sent from
the woods and cabins might enter a loophole: a
number did pass through the narrow windows and
were buried in the heavy logs beyond.</p>

<p>Unless the inmates were specially careful, one
or more of these invisible messengers would strike
them, and it was this hope which led the assailants
to keep up the desultory firing for more than
an hour succeeding the remarkable incidents on
the clearing.</p>

<p>The garrison did not throw away their ammunition:
they kept a sharp lookout for signs of their
enemies, and, when there was a chance of doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
execution, they were quick to take advantage of
it, but there was no shooting at random, as is too
often the case, under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>While these dropping shots were heard from
many different points, the figure of the fallen
Wyandot was stretched on the clearing in front
of the block-house. It lay flat on its back, with
the swarthy face turned upward, still and motionless,
and an impressive evidence of the frightful
and inexcusable enmity of the members of the
same human family toward each other.</p>

<p>No one ventured to approach it, although the
American Indian leaves no effort untried to remove
his dead from the battle-ground. They
would have gone forward on the present occasion
to withdraw the remains, but they could not
expect immunity from the rifles of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, the dead warrior
must wait until the darkness of the night, which
is the chosen season of his race for carrying out
his designs against all enemies.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, who had followed the trail and lived
in the woods for many years, was intensely mortified
over his failure, and carefully reloading his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
gun, resolved that the blunder on his part should
be retrieved.</p>

<p>He cautioned the new arrivals, and especially
the children of Mrs. Preston, to keep away from
the loopholes, through which the leaden missiles
were likely to come any moment, on their mission
of death. The good mother was too sensible of
the peril to which they were all exposed, to allow
her children to run any risk that could be avoided:
there were places both above and below stairs,
where no bullet could penetrate, and she made
certain that her children never wandered beyond
these somewhat narrow limits.</p>

<p>As soon as the door was securely fastened
behind the entrance of Blossom Brown and Ned
Preston, the Colonel, who, of course, was on the
lower floor, grasped each in turn by the hand and
congratulated them most warmly. Mrs. Preston,
as soon as it was safe, descended the ladder and
joined in the expressions of thankfulness.</p>

<p>Both the boys were panting from their tremendous
exertions, and they sat down each on a chair
until they could recover breath. As Ned drew
forth the letters from his inner pocket and handed
them to the Colonel, he said&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the hardest struggle of my life; I
never want to go through such another."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt in any way?" asked his aunt,
laying her hand on the head of her nephew, who
had taken off his cap and was drawing his handkerchief
across his forehead.</p>

<p>"Not in the least, and I thank heaven, for,
when that Wyandot let drive his tomahawk, it
came like a cannon-ball, and if it hadn't struck
my rifle-barrel as it did, it would have ended my
days. I wonder whether it hurt the gun," suddenly
added Ned, with that rapid transition from
one subject to another which is characteristic of
boyhood.</p>

<p>He examined the weapon, but although the
brown barrel was pretty well scraped, it showed
no real injury, and, in accordance with the teachings
of his father, Ned now proceeded to reload
the piece, while the dull reports of the guns, overhead
and along the edge of the woods and the
bank of the river, were heard.</p>

<p>By this time, Blossom Brown had recovered his
breath, and he imitated the example of his young
master. When he had completed his task, he
regained a great deal of his assurance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"Tings was sort ob lively for a while," he remarked
in his offhand manner, as though there
was nothing remarkable in their escape, "but I
knowed we was comin' out all right."</p>

<p>"How could you know that," asked the surprised
Mrs. Preston, "when we could not be
certain, until you were both within the house?"</p>

<p>"I seed from de way dat Injine drawed back
his tomahawk and squinted his eye, dat he wasn't
goin' to shoot straight, and I knowed too dat de
tomahawk was gwine to glance along de barrel
jes' as it did, which am why I moved off to one
side so dat it wouldn't tech me."</p>

<p>"That won't do," said Ned, with a shake of the
head; "you knew just as much as I did, which
was nothing at all."</p>

<p>"P'raps I did and p'raps I didn't," said Blossom
in his loftiest manner, throwing his head back;
"I neber brag ob what I'm doin', but I show
from de way I act dat I knows what's what. I
seed dat tings was gettin' mixed, and so I started
for de house to impress de Colonel how it was and
to git him to manage tings right."</p>

<p>At this moment, Mary and Susie Preston
hurried down the ladder to greet their cousin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"O Ned!" they shouted together, as they came
near tumbling through the rounds; "we're so glad
to see you!"</p>

<p>And the words were scarcely out of their mouths,
when Susie, the younger, leaped from the middle
round straight into the arms of Ned, which were
outspread to receive her. Mary embraced the waist
of the sturdy lad and insisted on attention. So
Ned, after kissing the younger several times, set
her down on the floor and did the same with the
elder. Then he resumed his chair, and, holding
them on his knees, laughed and talked as though
he had passed through no such fearful scene as we
have described, and as though no peril was yet
impending over their heads.</p>

<p>"I knew the wicked Indians wouldn't hurt
you," said little Susie, turning her pretty face up
to that of her cousin.</p>

<p>"And how could you know that, little one?"</p>

<p>"'Cause Mary and I prayed to God, when we
saw you coming across the clearing, to take care
of you."</p>

<p>"Well, I prayed hard too," said Ned, "and
then did the best I knew how, and I think God
always takes care of those who do that: it isn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
any use of praying unless you try to help yourselves."</p>

<p>This was orthodox, though the sentiment was
not very original, and the little sisters subscribed
to it as fully as though they had been taught it
at their mother's knee.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston had delivered the letters to the
parties to whom they belonged, and had read his
own. He had looked out for the opportunity to
use his gun, but saw none, and he now turned
about and gave his whole attention to his
"recruits."</p>

<p>"Where is Deerfoot?" was his first natural
question.</p>

<p>"He was on the edge of the clearing, when we
left, and I suppose he is there yet, unless the
Wyandots have driven him out."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely he has been allowed to stay
there long, for I notice that some of the shots
come from that direction. How was it he befriended
you as he did?"</p>

<p>"He is a great friend of mine, you know,
Uncle."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I mean; how was it he brought
you here and helped you to enter the block-house?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>In a few words, Ned Preston told the story
which is already known to the reader. Before it
was finished, the Colonel saw plainly the purpose
of the Shawanoe youth.</p>

<p>"He believed there was instant necessity for me
to have more guns at command, and that was
why he used such great exertion to run you in."</p>

<p>"Do you think he did right, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"I must say I cannot see the necessity of his
taking such terrible risks, when your help,
although very welcome, was not so all important
that our lives depended on it. Inasmuch as all of
you were safely on the outside, where Jo Stinger
tried so hard to get, it would have been the wiser
plan, in my opinion, for you to have made all
haste to Wild Oaks: the distance is not so great
that you could not have brought help to us within
two or three days."</p>

<p>"That is just the way I put the case to Deerfoot;
but he insisted that the first thing to be
done was to place us inside the block-house, and
nothing could change his view. He knows so
much more about such things than we, that I
could not refuse to do as he wished."</p>

<p>"He may have had reasons which he has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
made known, for he is an extraordinary Indian,
although still a boy."</p>

<p>"That arrow which came through the window
was a surprise, was it not?"</p>

<p>"A very great one: no one had any thought
that it was anything other than a hostile one. I
supposed it was intended to set fire to the building."</p>

<p>"Did you see it coming?"</p>

<p>"None of us saw it; but the thud it made,
when it struck, told us its nature, and I went
down to find out whether it was likely to do any
damage. The moment my eyes rested on it, I
noticed the paper tied around the shaft: that told
the story, of course, and soon every one within
knew the message. Well, you were not long in
getting the signal you asked for, and you know the
rest. That was a wonderful shot of the young
Shawanoe."</p>

<p>"And would you believe, Uncle, that he told
me after making it, that, if he had missed sending
the arrow through the window, it would have
been the death of all three of us."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"The Wyandots would have found it and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
have been quick to learn what it meant: then, as
he said, we were in such a position that we could
not get away from them."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he spoke the truth, which
shows what a fearful risk he ran; but he must
have had great confidence in his ability to use his
bow."</p>

<p>"And he has good reason for his confidence, as
he has proven more than once; but, in spite of all
his skill, I cannot help feeling that he has put
himself in a trap from which he cannot free himself.
Because the Wyandots have surrounded the
block-house, and because some of them are always
watching it, they must have seen the flight of the
shaft through the air."</p>

<p>"If they did, they could not have known its
errand."</p>

<p>"No, but they would recall that none of them
use the bow except to shoot burning arrows, and
they would be apt to suspect something was
wrong."</p>

<p>"They often use such things to set fire to
buildings."</p>

<p>"But this was not one, as they could have seen
with but a single glance; and, had it been, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
would have known all about it, if it was discharged
by one of their own party."</p>

<p>"Ned," said Colonel Preston, "I have been
talking against my own convictions, just to see
what you thought about it: I agree with you.
Subtle as the Shawanoe is, beyond any of his years,
he has done a thing for which I cannot see the
reason, and I believe he has placed himself in peril
that admits of no escape. If such proves to be
the case, he has also deprived himself of the opportunity
to do us the great service we need."</p>

<p>"'Scuse me," interrupted Blossom Brown, who
had been showing uneasiness for several minutes,
and who was now snuffing the air in a suggestive
way; "I tinks I smell corn bread, and I haben't
dined dis mornin' yet."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="s08">FLAMING MESSENGERS.</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Preston laughed and asked the boys to
pardon her for having forgotten, in the excitement
of the occasion, the duty of hospitality.
The morning meal had been furnished the others,
and she now gave her nephew and Blossom Brown
the best she could prepare.</p>

<p>The two were ahungered and ate heartily. It
was a striking commentary on the perils of the
life of the early settlers that, while they were thus
engaged, the sound of the rifles was heard, as they
were fired from the upper story, in answer to the
shots from the Wyandots.</p>

<p>But we can become accustomed to almost any
danger, and the appetites of the re-enforcements
were not affected by what was going on around
them. The windows on the first floor admitted
several bullets from the guns of the dusky marksmen,
but every person was careful to keep out of
range. When the meal was finished, all climbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the ladder to the second story, where the boys
were welcomed by the men who stood at the
loopholes with their smoking guns in their
hands.</p>

<p>There was more security there, because the
openings through which the leaden balls could
enter were much smaller; but, as evidence of the
marksmanship of their enemies, Jo Stinger informed
them that three bullets had struck the
interior walls, one of which actually came along
the barrel of a gun, narrowly missing Megill who
was in the act of thrusting it forth.</p>

<p>"That is well for the Wyandots," said the
Colonel, "but have you done anything to teach
them that the skill is not all on their side?"</p>

<p>"We suspect we have: Jim caught sight of a
warrior creeping along for a position behind the
cabin yonder, and when he fired, the fellow acted
as though something struck him."</p>

<p>"And have not <i>you</i>, the best marksman in the
company, succeeded in doing as well as he?"</p>

<p>"He has done better," replied Turner; "for
one of the rascals in the cabin out there had the
impudence to thrust forth his painted face in plain
sight; and when Jo drew bead on him and fired,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
he dropped out of view and has not been seen
since."</p>

<p>"I hope it was the one who flung his tomahawk
at me, and which is still sticking in the door,"
said Ned Preston.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been," said the hunter, with
an expressive shrug, "for if it had been, I would
have missed him. I never made such a mess in
all my life as I did a while ago."</p>

<p>"Accidents will happen," laughed the Colonel;
"and we have every reason to congratulate ourselves
that no one has been harmed, though we
have been exposed to great danger. It was a most
providential thing that I learned of the coming
of the war party, before they were ready for the
attack."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the number in the
woods?" asked Jo Stinger.</p>

<p>"My nephew Ned tells me that Deerfoot the
Shawanoe, who ought to be the best authority, says
there are certainly fifty, for he saw nearly that
many, and he thinks it more than likely there are
twice that number."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt there are all of a hundred,"
observed Jo Stinger, "judging from the way they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
sent in the shots a few minutes ago; but they
have stopped, because they must see that nothing
can be gained by such wild firing."</p>

<p>The hunter was right in his last remark, the
stillness being as profound as if no living person
was within miles of them.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston told all that had been learned
through his nephew of the doings of Deerfoot the
Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"He has put himself in a bad fix," said Stinger,
with another shake of the head: "I know he is
one of the cutest varmints in the wilds of Kentucky,
but there are some things which he can't do,
and I believe he has undertook one of 'em now."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so, but I hope not."</p>

<p>"There has been something going on out there
by the Licking, where that arrow of his came
from, and, if I ain't mistook, it means they have
dropped down on him this time."</p>

<p>Ned Preston heard these words with a pang, for
the death or suffering of the Shawanoe youth would
have been an affliction to him like the loss of a
brother. There was that unswerving loyalty, self-sacrificing
friendship, and astonishing woodcraft
which go to make up the ideal American Indian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and which, though rarely encountered in these
later days, still actually existed a century or more
ago, as it does now among the aboriginal inhabitants
of our country. Not often was it seen, but
there are historical facts which attest the truth of
such characters belonging to the Algonquin family
of red men.</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if Heaven raised up Deerfoot
to be such a friend to the white people, as
Pocahontas was during the early New England
settlements."</p>

<p>Such was the thought that had come to Ned
Preston more than once and which thought was
the echo of the one uttered by his father months
before. The lad did not repeat the words now,
but the expression of pain which crossed his face,
told his anguish more impressively than the words
themselves could have done.</p>

<p>Without making reply, the youth stepped to
one of the loopholes on the western side of the
block-house and looked out toward the river, fixing
his gaze on the point where he had parted
company with the Indian youth.</p>

<p>Everything was as quiet as at "creation's
morn." The glimmer of the flowing Licking, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
dim, solemn woods, the unsightly stumps on the
clearing, the blue sky above and beyond&mdash;all these
wore the peaceful look they wore when no peril
threatened the diminutive settlement.</p>

<p>Only one figure&mdash;that of the Wyandot warrior,
stark and stiff in the sunlight&mdash;spoke of the
dreadful scenes that had been enacted on that
spot such a brief while before.</p>

<p>Ned scrutinized the little clump of bushes
which had sheltered the young Shawanoe, when
making his marvelous shot with his bow and
arrow, but not the first sign of life was visible.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether to take heart from that
or not," said the lad to himself; "for, if they
had captured Deerfoot, I should think they would
make some display over it, so as to impress us."</p>

<p>"If they got the young redskin," observed Jo
Stinger, standing at the elbow of Ned, "it
wouldn't have been <i>there</i>; that varmint would
have made a fight, and he would have given
them a good run before they brought him
down."</p>

<p>Ned Preston felt the force of this declaration,
but he stood silent several minutes longer, still
watching the bushes with a weak hope that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
would give some sign that would bid him take
heart.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed, and, withdrawing his
gaze, he looked at the well which stood very near
the middle of the square within the stockade.</p>

<p>"Uncle," said Ned, addressing his relative
without regard to his military title, "I heard you
tell father that you meant to dig a well inside the
block-house, so the Indians could not cut off the
water."</p>

<p>"I did intend to do so, and it ought to have
been done long ago, but you know that men, like
boys, are apt to put off till to-morrow that which
should be done to-day."</p>

<p>"The Wyandots can destroy that well any
night, or they can tear away some of the stockades
so as to shoot any one who goes near it."</p>

<p>"That is self-evident, I am sorry to say."</p>

<p>"You have a barrel of water in the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an abundance for every purpose, excepting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Colonel hesitated and smiled: all knew
what he meant. The most dangerous enemy they
had to fear, was the very one against which no
efficient provision had been made.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>When the block-house was erected, and for a
considerable time after, it was practically fire-proof,
from the greenness of its timbers. The hewn logs,
plastered between with dried clay, could not be
easily ignited under the most favorable circumstances,
if thoroughly seasoned by the elements;
but, when they contained an abundance of sap,
there was nothing to fear from such cause.</p>

<p>It was somewhat the same with the slabs which
composed the roof. They were green at first, but
they had been baked for months and years, and a
dry summer had not been long ended, so that they
were in reality in a very combustible state. Such
solid pieces of oak do not take a flame readily, but,
to say the least, there were grounds for grave
anxiety.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston reproached himself more than
did any of his friends, for this neglect, but it must
be borne in mind that the peril was one which
threatened almost every such station on the frontier
during the early days, and it was one which the
hardy pioneers had learned to combat, with a success
that often defeated the most daring assailants.</p>

<p>As no immediate attack was feared, the occupants
of the block-house disposed themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
as fancy prompted. Blossom Brown stretched out
on a blanket in a corner and was soon sound
asleep. Megill and Turner did the same, the
others occupied seats, with the exception of Mrs.
Preston, who, like a good housewife, moved hither
and thither, making preparations for the noon-day
meal of the garrison, while she kept her children
under her eye and made sure they did not wander
into dangerous portions of the building.</p>

<p>Ned Preston played with the little girls, told
them stories and taught them numerous games of
which they had never heard, and which he had
picked up for their benefit.</p>

<p>Now and then he walked around the four sides
of the room, looking carefully through the loopholes
and exchanging theories with his uncle, who
employed himself in much the same manner.</p>

<p>Thus the time wore on until the day was half
gone. The sky was clearer than twenty-four hours
before, and the sun was visible most of the time,
but the air was crisp and wintry, and the slight
warmth from the fire on the hearth down-stairs
was pleasant to those who could feel the grateful
glow.</p>

<p>Hours passed without any noticeable change.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
At noontime, there was a general awaking, yawning,
and stretching of limbs, accompanied by
peeps through the loopholes and an expression of
views respecting the situation. Mrs. Preston
passed the dinner to each, and they ate, sitting on
chairs and the bench, drinking sparingly from the
water that had been collected against such an
emergency.</p>

<p>Most of the company were in good spirits, for
the siege had not continued long enough for them
to feel its irksomeness, nor had the demonstrations
assumed a character to cause real uneasiness and
misgiving of the issue.</p>

<p>After dinner, Colonel Preston and his nephew
secured two hours' sleep, but both were too much
concerned to remain unconscious as long as did
the others.</p>

<p>When Ned recovered himself, he walked straight
to the southern side of the room and peered
through one of the openings. This gave him a
view of the two cabins, deserted the day before by
the pioneers who had occupied them so long.</p>

<p>He saw nothing alarming on or about these
structures, but all at once something arrested his
eye, just beyond the first cabin and on the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the forest. At first, he could not conjecture what
it meant, but as he looked steadily, he observed
that it was a smoking point, showing that an
object was burning, although Ned was far from
suspecting its real nature.</p>

<p>Once or twice, he fancied he saw a person moving
directly behind it; but if such were the fact,
the individual kept himself well hidden.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tuft of smoke and a fiery point were
seen to rise swiftly in the air, and, curving over in
a beautiful parabola, descend toward the roof of
the block-house. A moment after it struck with
a quick thud and then slid down the steep incline
to the ground.</p>

<p>Although the burning shaft was intended to
stick fast and communicate fire to the dry roof,
it did not do so, but fell harmlessly to the earth,
where it lay smoking and burning directly under
the eyes of the startled garrison who looked down
on it.</p>

<p>"I expected it," quietly remarked Colonel
Preston, after surveying the burning missile.</p>

<p>"There will be plenty of fireworks to-night,"
added Jo Stinger, "for that's a fav'rit style with
the varmints."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>This new demonstration had the effect of driving
all the garrison to the loopholes, Blossom
Brown being among the most anxious to watch
the actions of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Preston looked through the narrow
openings with as much interest as did any of
them, while little Mary and Susie must needs be
given a peep at their familiar surroundings.</p>

<p>The red men having discharged one fiery arrow,
waited a long time before repeating the demonstration.
As it was deemed likely that the next
missile would be sent from another point, a
watch was maintained on every side of the block-house.</p>

<p>"<i>Hello, here she come agin!</i>"</p>

<p>It was Jo Stinger who uttered the exclamation,
and he was facing the Licking river. There was a
general rush across the room to gain a view of the
flaming shaft, but before it could be done, it struck
the roof above, held a minute, and then, as if its
grip was burned away, it was distinctly heard as
it fell over and slowly slid down the planks and
dropped to the ground, as did the first one.</p>

<p>"If they do that every time," said Ned Preston,
"they won't cause us much harm."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like it," replied the Colonel; "it kept
its place too long on the roof."</p>

<p>"Not long enough to do any damage."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure: I must see."</p>

<p>Drawing a chair beneath the trap-door, he
stepped on it and cautiously raised the planks a
few inches. This permitted a view of all the
roof on that side. He observed a scorched spot
within reach of his hand, but there was no
evidence of injury from the flaming arrow which
struck and held a brief time.</p>

<p>The trap was closed again, and the Colonel
stepped down from the chair. All looked expectantly
at him, but beyond telling what he had
seen, he said nothing.</p>

<p>The interest of the garrison was such that they
kept their places at the loopholes, through which
they scrutinized the clearing, the cabins and the
woods beyond, watchful to detect the first evidence
of what their enemies were doing.</p>

<p>This close attention caused the autumn afternoon
to seem much longer than it really was, but
nothing more took place to give the defenders any
uneasiness. They saw the shades of night once
more closing about them, while they were environed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
so closely on every hand by the vengeful
Wyandots, that flight for any one was utterly out
of the question.</p>

<p>"Wait till night comes," said Jo Stinger meaningly;
"then you will hear music and see sights!"</p>

<p>Every one knew what the old scout meant by
his quaint language, and every one believed he
spoke the truth, as in fact he did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="s08">IN GREAT PERIL.</span></h2>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe had drawn his
arrow to the head and was in the very act
of launching it at the Wyandot who was advancing
on Ned Preston, when he saw that it was unnecessary.</p>

<p>The puff of blue smoke from one of the portholes,
the whiplike crack of the Kentuckian's
rifle, the death-shriek of the warrior, as he staggered
back and dropped to the earth, told the
startling story too plainly to be mistaken.</p>

<p>With the faintest possible sigh, the dusky youth
relaxed the tension on the string, but he still
leaned forward and peered through the bushes,
for the danger was not yet past. He more than
suspected the needle-pointed shaft would have to
be sent after the second Indian who pressed the
lad so close; but, as the reader knows, Ned Preston
darted through the entrance in the very nick
of time, just escaping the tomahawk which whizzed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
over his head and buried itself half way to
the head in the solid puncheon slabs of the door.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thanks the Great Spirit of the white
men," the Indian youth muttered, looking reverently
upward, "that his brother, whom he loves
more than his own life, is unharmed."</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe felt that no time was to
be lost in attending to his own safety. More than
likely some one of the Wyandots had caught sight
of the arrow, as it sailed through the air, with its
important message, and the meeting of the previous
day told him he was regarded with suspicion
already.</p>

<p>He saw no Indians near him and he cautiously
retreated in the direction of the river, which
flowed only a short distance from him. The
bushes and undergrowth, although they had lost
most of their leaves, served him well as a screen,
and, when he had advanced three or four rods to
the northward, he began to feel more hopeful,
though, it need scarcely be said, he did not relax
his extraordinary caution in the least.</p>

<p>His purpose was to follow the river bank, until
he had passed beyond the surrounding Wyandots,
after which it would be an easy matter to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
his way to Wild Oaks, with the news of the sore
extremity of the block-house. It was reasonable
to believe that Waughtauk and his warriors would
guard every point much more closely than the
Licking directly in front of the station, for the
one hundred yards of open clearing made it impossible
for any person to approach or leave the
building in the daytime, without exposing himself
to a raking fire, before reaching a point as
close as that attained by Ned Preston and Blossom
Brown, when they were checked by the two warriors.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, therefore, was warranted in thinking
he had selected the least guarded point, though
he could not be sure of success, after the discharge
of the arrow through the narrow window.</p>

<p>The few rods were passed as noiselessly as the
hand of the clock creeps over its face, when the
Shawanoe became aware that he was close to
several Wyandots. He had not seen them, but
that strange subtlety, or intuition, which in some
human beings seems like a sixth sense, told him
of the fact.</p>

<p>He immediately sank flat on his face, and, by
an imperceptible effort, continued to advance toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the warriors, at a much slower rate than
before. Ten feet were passed in this guarded
fashion, when he stopped: he had learned enough.</p>

<p>Between himself and the top of the bank, where
it was level with the clearing, was less than twelve
feet. This space sloped irregularly downward to
the edge of the stream, and it was covered in
many places by a rank undergrowth, which, when
bearing leaves, would have been an effectual
screen for an Indian or wild animal.</p>

<p>Besides this scraggly vegetation, there were
logs, limbs and debris of freshets that had been
brought down the river and had collected along
the shores. This will explain why it was that
such extreme caution was required on the part of
any one who sought to avoid detection.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot stopped, he was at a point from
which he saw three Wyandots, each with a gun in
his hand, gazing over the clearing in the direction
of the block-house. They seemed to be intently
occupied, but no living person could pass between
them and the river, which almost touched the feet
of one, without discovery.</p>

<p>It was utterly useless to look for escape in that
direction, and without a minute's pause, the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Shawanoe worked his way back to where he was
standing when he used his bow, wondering as he
did so, why the twang of the string had not
caught the ears of the Wyandots so near him.</p>

<p>He now turned about, so as to face up stream,
and tried what might be called the only recourse
left. If he was shut off in that direction, he was
in the worst dilemma of his life.</p>

<p>An almost incredible experience awaited him,
for at about the same distance as before, he discovered
he was near others of his enemies, as he
was compelled to regard the Wyandots. Rather
curiously, when he advanced far enough to look
through the bushes, he once more discerned three
of them.</p>

<p>They were bestowing most of their attention on
the block-house, and one of them discharged his
gun toward it, their friends further down the river
doing the same.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was somewhat closer to them than to
the others, for fortunately he found a partly decayed
log, lying directly across his path, and he
used this as a partial screen, though by doing so,
he increased the difficulty of his withdrawal,
should it suddenly become necessary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>The young Shawanoe had scarcely secured the
position, when the warriors began talking in their
own tongue, which was as familiar to Deerfoot as
his own.</p>

<p>He was so close that he did not lose a single
word of the conversation, which, as may be suspected,
was of no little interest to himself.</p>

<p>"The pale-face is a brave youth, and he runs
like Deerfoot, the son of the Shawanoe chieftain
Allomaug."</p>

<p>"The Long Knives flee, when the Wyandots
leave their villages and hunt for them."</p>

<p>"The Yenghese are not brave," said the third
warrior, who had just fired his gun, and who used
another term by which the Caucasian was distinguished
from his copper-hued brother; "they
run like the rabbits, when the hunter drives them
from cover; they fled into the strong lodge, when
they saw the shadow of Waughtauk coming from
the north."</p>

<p>"They will hide behind the logs till their
brothers along the Ohio can haste to help them,"
observed the first speaker, who seemed to be the
pessimist of the party; "their lodge is strong,
and the Wyandot braves cannot break it down."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>Deerfoot, from his concealment, saw the painted
face of the other warrior, as it was turned indignantly
on the croaker.</p>

<p>"My brother talks like the squaw who thinks
the voice of the wind, when it blows among the
trees at night, is that of the panther and bear
that are pushing their noses under her lodge to
turn it over; has Arawa no heart, that he speaks
so like a squaw that is ill?"</p>

<p>Arawa seemed to feel somewhat ashamed of
himself and made no reply: he would doubtless
have been glad if the drift of the conversation
should change, but as his companions showed no
eagerness to change it, he launched out boldly
himself:</p>

<p>"Why did we not shoot the pale-face youth and
him with the color of the night, when they hastened
across the open ground? It was ours to do so."</p>

<p>"We thought there was no escape for them,
and there would not be in many moons should
they run again."</p>

<p>"But they cannot save the Yenghese dogs, for
the strong lodge shall be burned down before the
sun shows itself again in the east," observed the
optimist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"Many moons ago, when the face of the sun
was all fire, we tried to burn the strong lodge, but
the flame ran away from us and it will do so many
times more."</p>

<p>This was Arawa the pessimist, croaking once
more, and the others scowled so fiercely upon him,
that they seemed on the point of offering violence
with a view of modifying his views; but, if so,
they changed their minds, and one of them
tendered some information:</p>

<p>"The sun and the winds and the moon have
made the roof of the strong lodge like the wood
with which Arawa makes the fire in his wigwam;
it is not as it was many moons ago."</p>

<p>Arawa seemed on the point of opening his
mouth to say that, while the moon and the winds
and the sun had been engaged in the drying out
process, the snows and storms and tempests had
been taking part; but if such was his intention,
he changed his mind and made a remark of
still more vital interest to the cowen near the
log.</p>

<p>"The pale-face dogs, and he with the countenance
of the night, must have had the serpent-tongued
Deerfoot to help them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>This startling statement seemed to be endorsed
by the other two, one of whom said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arawa speaks the truth."</p>

<p>"Arawa reads what he sees aright," added the
other, while Deerfoot himself felt that all three
had hit the nail on the head with astonishing
accuracy.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot of the Shawanoes is a dog," observed
one of the warriors, "and he shall die the
death of a dog."</p>

<p>The individual referred to was rather relieved
to hear this declaration, because in order to inflict
the death of a dog on him, it would be necessary
first to catch him&mdash;a condition which implied that
the Wyandots would make every effort to take
him prisoner, instead of shooting him on sight, as
they often did with others.</p>

<p>Where such a strong attempt should be made,
it gave the young friend of the white men a much
greater chance of eluding his foes.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, while grouped together and
occasionally firing a gun at the block-house, continued
their derogatory remarks about the young
Shawanoe, who did not lose a word. He could
see them distinctly: one had his back toward him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
most of the time, but he turned now and then so
that his profile was visible. The lynx eyes of the
youth noticed the flaming red, which was daubed
over his face, crossed with zebra-like streaks of
black, with circles on the forehead and promiscuous
dots here and there; the irregular nose, the
bridge of which had been broken, and the retreating
chin,&mdash;all of which rendered this particular
Wyandot as ugly of countenance as the imagination
can picture.</p>

<p>The others, however, were not much improvement
as respects looks: one had a projecting
underchin, the other a very broad face, and the
three were anything but pleasing in appearance.</p>

<p>Stealthily studying them, Deerfoot knew that,
like all the other warriors surrounding the block-house,
they were his deadly enemies, and would
leave no effort untried to capture him the moment
they became aware of his presence.</p>

<p>But to escape, it was necessary to pass beyond
them, and desperate as was the chance, Deerfoot
saw a faint hope of success, enough to lead him
to make the attempt.</p>

<p>The Wyandots were further up the bank than
were the others, and there was more vegetation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
and shrubbery there than lower down stream;
but, for all that, the chance was a forlorn one
indeed.</p>

<p>Deerfoot relied mainly on the fact that the
interest of the warriors was absorbed in the block-house
itself: if they should continue to give it
their whole attention, he might be able to move
by them undiscovered.</p>

<p>More than once, he had scrutinized the Licking,
but with no encouraging result. Had it been very
deep close to the bank, he would have wished no
more favorable conditions. He could swim a long
distance under water and dive so far as to elude
almost any kind of pursuit.</p>

<p>But the stream was too shallow to be of any use
in that respect, and he would have been forced to
wade a long way before finding a sufficient depth
to benefit him.</p>

<p>Whether he would have succeeded in flanking
the Wyandots, had everything remained as it was,
is an open question, for the conditions were overwhelmingly
against him. But an obstacle appeared
of which not even the acute-minded Shawanoe
dreamed.</p>

<p>At the very moment he began moving from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
behind the rotten log, with a view of pushing
beyond, his trained ear caught a faint rattling
noise, like the whirr of a locust. He knew that it
was the warning of a rattlesnake which he had
disturbed by his slight change of position.</p>

<p>Singularly enough it was below the log and
close to the water: it must have been moving toward
the side where the Shawanoe was hiding,
when it discovered him. It instantly began drawing
itself rapidly in coil and prepared to strike its
enemy.</p>

<p>Deerfoot saw that it was at just the right distance
to bury its fangs in his face. He made the
quickest retreat of his life. He did not become
panic-stricken, but slid back several feet, so
silently that he made less noise than did the
<i>crotalus</i> itself, which was not heard by the
Wyandots, who were so much interested in
the block-house and its immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>The action of the young Indian seemed to
surprise the serpent, which found its prey beyond
reach at the moment it was ready to launch its
needle-pointed fangs into his body. With the
tail slightly elevated, the snake continued vibrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
it slowly and giving forth a sound like the
faint chirping of crickets.</p>

<p>Deerfoot extracted a single arrow from his
quiver, and, while lying on his face, supported on
his right elbow, drew back the missile as though
it was a javelin which he was about to cast at an
enemy.</p>

<p>The distance was short, and he knew what he
could do. Like a flash his left hand shot forward,
and the flint of the arrow went directly through
the narrow portion of the rattlesnake's body, a
few inches below its head. So powerful was the
throw that the upper portion was carried backward
and pinned to the earth.</p>

<p>The <i>crotalus</i> species is so easily killed that a
slight blow is sufficient to render it helpless. The
arrow, which had transfixed the serpent in front
of Deerfoot, destroyed the reptile so suddenly that
it made only a few furious whippings, when it
was dead.</p>

<p>The youth felt not the slightest fear of the
reptile, but he dreaded lest its threshings should
attract the notice of the Wyandots, whom he
furtively watched, until the rattlesnake lay
still.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>One of the warriors did look around, as though
he heard something unusual, but he seemed satisfied
with a mere glance, and, turning back,
sighted his gun at the block-house and threw
away a charge, as so many of his people were doing
around him.</p>

<p>"Now is my chance," thought Deerfoot, as he
once more began his stealthy, shadow-like creeping
around the decayed log, from behind which
had glided the venomous serpent that confronted
him.</p>

<p>The dead reptile still lay in his path, and Deerfoot
reached his bow forward, thrust one end under
it and flung it aside, for he shared the sentiments
of the great generality of mankind, who look
upon all ophidians as the most detestable plagues
which encumber the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="s08">"BIRDS OF THE NIGHT."</span></h2>

<p>The garrison within the block-house saw the
November day draw to an end, and the darkness
of night closing in over river, forest and
clearing, with sad forebodings of what was to
come before the rising of the morrow's sun.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston and Jo Stinger agreed that the
experiment with the burning arrows had resulted
more favorably to the Wyandots than to the
whites. The flaming missiles were undoubtedly
launched as a test or experiment. True, each
one had fallen to the ground without inflicting
material damage, but one of them clung to its
position so long as to encourage the assailants to
repeat the attempt.</p>

<p>"When the roof is stuck full of 'em," said
Stinger, "and they're p'inting upward like the
quills of a porcupine, and every one of them
arrers is a camp-fire of itself, why then, look
out,&mdash;that's all I've got to say."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"I know of no reason why&mdash;hello! there's
another!"</p>

<p>The speakers ran to the loopholes and looked
out. Megill said it had been fired from the cabin
nearest them: he had noticed the wisp of burning
tow at the moment it sprang upward from the
window. The archer who dispatched it, kept
himself out of view, Megill only catching sight of
his brawny hand, as he launched the flaming
shaft.</p>

<p>This arrow was not heard to slide down the
roof and fall to the ground as did the others. It
kept its place, and so profound was the stillness
within the block-house that every one distinctly
heard the crackling of the flames overhead.</p>

<p>More than one heart beat faster, as the friends
looked at each other, and more than one face
blanched, when the full import of this ominous
occurrence became known.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger drew his chair beneath the trap-door
and carefully lifted the slabs a few inches. He
saw the arrow, which had been fired with astonishing
accuracy, and which had been sent to such a
height that it descended almost perpendicularly,
the flint-head sinking a full inch in the dry wood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>This rapid sweep through air had fanned the
twist of tow into a strong blaze, and it was now
burning vigorously. The flame was so hot indeed
that the shaft had caught fire, and it looked, at
the first glance, as though it would communicate
with the roof itself.</p>

<p>This was hardly likely; though, as Stinger himself
had declared, the danger would be very imminent
when a large number were burning at the
same time on different portions of the top of the
building.</p>

<p>The pioneer extended the barrel of his rifle
until he reached the burning missile, when he
knocked it loose by a smart blow. As before, it
slid down the steeply shelving roof and dropped,
smoking, to the ground, where it burned itself
harmlessly away.</p>

<p>The expectation was general on the part of the
garrison that a shower of burning arrows would
now be sent from every portion of the wood. The
suspense was great, but, to the surprise of all,
the minutes passed without any demonstration of
the kind.</p>

<p>The night, like the preceding one, was chilly
and crisp, but it was clearer. A gibbous moon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
shone from the sky, save when the straggling
clouds drifted across its face, and sent grotesque
shadows gliding along the clearing and over the
block-house and woods. A dozen black specks,
almost in the shape of the letter Y, suddenly
passed over the moon, and the honking cry which
sounded high up in air, showed they were wild
geese flying southward.</p>

<p>As the minutes wore on without any molestation
from the Wyandots, Mrs. Preston went down
the ladder and started the smouldering embers
into life. This was not for the purpose of cooking,
for enough of that was done at noon, and the
rations had already been distributed; but it was
with a view of adding to the comfort of those
above, by giving them a little warmth.</p>

<p>She took care to keep out of the range of any
lurking red men who might steal up and fire
through the windows on the opposite side, the
only spot from which a shot could reach her; but
to attain the point of firing, an Indian would have
been forced to scale the stockade, and none of them
as yet had attempted that.</p>

<p>Ned Preston stooped at the loophole, looking
out over the clearing toward the Licking, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
which he and Blossom Brown had made such a
daring run for life and liberty. Out in the darkness
beyond, he had parted from Deerfoot the
Shawanoe, the Indian youth who was so deeply
attached to him. Ned more than suspected his
friend had given up his life for his sake. Placed,
as was Deerfoot, there seemed to be no possibility
of his eluding the Wyandots, who looked upon
him as the worst of traitors that encumbered the
earth.</p>

<p>"He asked me about the Great Spirit of the
white man," thought Ned Preston, as he recalled
that conversation over the letter which was tied to
the arrow sent through the window; "and I
promised I would tell him something: I feel as
though I had not done my duty."</p>

<p>The lad was thoughtful a moment, oppressed
by the remorse which comes to us when we feel we
have thrown away an opportunity that may never
return; but he soon rallied, as he remembered the
words so often spoken by his good mother.</p>

<p>"God knows all hearts and he judges us aright:
if Deerfoot was groping after our Great Spirit, he
found him before he died, for God is so good and
kind that he has gone to him, but O how glad I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
would be, if I could only believe Deerfoot had got
away, and that I shall see him again!"</p>

<p>Ned Preston was roused from these gloomy reflections
by the discovery that something was
going on in front of him, though for some time
he could not divine its character.</p>

<p>The uncertain light of the moon annoyed him,
and prevented his learning what would have been
quickly detected by Jo Stinger.</p>

<p>When the moon shone with unobstructed light,
Ned could follow the outlines of the Wyandot
warrior stretched out in death on the clearing in
front: when the clouds drifted over its face,
everything was swallowed in darkness.</p>

<p>In the mood of young Preston, a person sometimes
shows a singular disposition to observe
trifling details and incidents. On almost any
other occasion he would not have noticed that the
body of the Wyandot lay in such a position that
the head was within an arm's length of a stump,
while the feet was about the same distance from
another.</p>

<p>At the moment of deepest mental depression,
the boy noted this, and he muttered to himself,
during the succeeding minutes, until the moon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
came out again from behind the clouds. Just
then he was looking toward the prostrate figure,
and he observed that it had shifted its position.</p>

<p>The head was within a few inches of a stump,
while the feet were correspondingly removed from
the other. The difference was so marked that
there was no room for self-deception in the
matter.</p>

<p>"It must be he is alive!" was the thought of
Ned, "and has been feigning death all these
hours."</p>

<p>He was on the point of calling to his uncle,
when he reflected that no mercy was likely to be
shown the warrior, in case he was only wounded.
Ned felt a sympathy for the poor wretch, and,
though he had been his most merciless enemy, the
boy resolved that he would do nothing to obstruct
his final escape.</p>

<p>He now centered his gaze on the figure and
watched it with deep interest. So long as the
flood of moonlight rested on it, it remained as
motionless as the stumps near it; but at the end
of ten minutes a thick cloud sailed slowly by the
orb, obscuring its light only a few minutes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as all was clear, Ned exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>He's moved again!</i>"</p>

<p>"That's so, but he had help."</p>

<p>It was Jo Stinger who stood at the elbow of
Ned, looking through the adjoining loophole. The
boy turned to the scout, and said in an entreating
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't shoot him, Jo; give the poor fellow a
chance!"</p>

<p>Jo laughed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't waste ammunition on dead men: that
varmint has been as dead as Julius Cæsar ever
since he was shot."</p>

<p>"But how does he manage to move himself
then?"</p>

<p>"Bless your soul, he doesn't do it: there's a
Wyandot behind that stump at his head, and he's
taking a hitch at him whenever the moon gives
him a show."</p>

<p>Ned Preston was astonished, for the truth had
never occurred to him. Jo added&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've catched a glimpse of him once or twice,
as he darted from one stump to another. He
came from the river bank, and I could have
picked him off, but I knowed what he's arter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
it's a principle with the Colonel and me, never to
interfere with the varmints when they want to
bury their dead."</p>

<p>Ned Preston was greatly relieved to hear this,
but the two said nothing to the others, through
fear that Megill or Turner would not be so considerate
of the wishes of the Colonel, whose
authority over them was more nominal than
actual.</p>

<p>The Wyandot who had taken on himself the
duty of carrying away the body of his fallen companion,
seemed to acquire confidence from his
success. While Ned and Stinger were watching
his movements, and while the moon shone with
unobstructed light, they saw the body drawn
entirely behind the stump, where, after some
maneuvering, the warrior partly straightened up,
holding the burden over his shoulders and back.</p>

<p>Then he sped with surprising quickness for the
river bank, down which he vanished with the load.</p>

<p>His work was done, and the deliverer doubtless
believed he had outwitted the whites, who could
have shot him without difficulty as he ran.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston, and indeed all the garrison,
were constantly expecting the shower of burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
arrows, and, because they were delayed, no one
dared hope the Wyandots had given over the intention
of burning them out of their refuge.</p>

<p>When Ned grew weary of scanning the clearing
with its uncertain light, he walked to the northern
side of the room which commanded a view of one
portion of the stockade.</p>

<p>Before doing so, he turned to converse a few
minutes with his uncle and aunt. There was no
light burning in the upper story, for the reason
that it was likely to serve as a guide to some of
the Indian marksmen who might steal up near
enough to fire through the loopholes.</p>

<p>The children had lain down in the corner,
where, after saying their prayers, they were sleeping
the sweet refreshing sleep of innocency and
childhood.</p>

<p>"Their mother is pretty well worn out," said
the Colonel, "and I have persuaded her to take a
little rest while the opportunity is hers."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, but there is no telling
when she will be awakened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello! there's more mischief!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was recognized as that of Jo
Stinger, who had also shifted his position to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
northern side. Colonel Preston and his nephew
instantly hastened to the loopholes and looked out
in the gloom, which just then was at its deepest,
as a mass of clouds were gradually gliding before
the moon, which could be seen only very faintly,
when some of the torn edges allowed its rays to
steal through.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jo?" asked the Colonel, rifle in
hand.</p>

<p>"About a minute ago, I seen the heads of two
of the varmints; I oughtn't to have hollered as I
did, but I was sort of took off my guard, as you
may say."</p>

<p>"Where were they?"</p>

<p>"Out yonder on the stockade; I make no doubt
they're climbing over."</p>

<p>"Give them a shot the moment you get the
chance."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I will," replied Jo, who was
just able to catch a glimpse of the moon, which
seemed to be struggling to free itself from the
clouds that were smothering it.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston and Ned also shoved their guns
through the loopholes, so as to be ready to fire
the instant the opportunity offered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>Jo had indicated the exact place, so that their
gaze was turned to the right point. The Wyandots
were not forgetful of the uncertain light
which alternately favored and opposed them.
When, therefore, the eyes were directed toward
the proper point, nothing was seen but the sharply
pointed pickets pointing upward, and which
looked as difficult to scale as the spiked fences of
modern days.</p>

<p>"They're there," whispered Jo, "and when you
see a head, blaze away at it."</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when the
outlines of a tufted crown appeared above the
stockade, where the Wyandot paused, as if peeping
over. Then a second was outlined at his
elbow, the two remaining stationary a full minute.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot just yet," whispered Stinger.</p>

<p>Ned wondered why the delay was suggested,
after his previous instruction; but, a moment
after, the two Wyandots, no doubt with the
assistance of others, suddenly rose higher, so that
their shoulders and bodies were dimly seen. They
were climbing over the stockade.</p>

<p>"<i>Now!</i>" said Jo Stinger.</p>

<p>All three fired, and the red men instantly vanished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
It was almost impossible to take fair aim,
but it looked as if the warriors had been "hit
hard."</p>

<p>"We dropped them," said Ned, with some excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, but they dropped themselves; they're
inside the stockade."</p>

<p>"What harm can two of them do, if they <i>are</i>
there?" asked Colonel Preston, quite hopeful that
they had slain the Indians.</p>

<p>"There are a half dozen of the varmints at
least inside," was the disquieting statement of
Stinger.</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to see them," observed
Colonel Preston, looking searchingly at the spot
where the two were discovered.</p>

<p>"When they stand still, you can't see 'em; but
when they stir around, you can just make 'em
out."</p>

<p>The reason why the Wyandots had selected this
side of the stockade, was now apparent. The
position of the moon in the heavens was such
that the pickets threw a wall of shadow several
feet within the square. When the warriors dropped
to the ground, they were in such gloom that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
it was almost impossible to see them, except when
they moved away from the fence.</p>

<p>All this being true, it still was not easy to divine
their purpose in climbing the pickets. So
long as they remained within the square, they
were in range of the Kentuckians' rifles as much
as though on the clearing in front.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="s08">SHADOWY VISITORS.</span></h2>

<p>When the eye gazes steadily at the Pleiades,
in the midnight splendor of the starlit sky,
one of the blazing orbs shrinks modestly from view
and only six remain to be admired by the wondering
gazer below: it is the quick, casual glance
that catches the brilliant sister unawares, before
she can hide her face.</p>

<p>So, when the pioneers within the block-house
looked intently at the stockade, they saw nothing
but the wall of shadow and the outline of the
sharp pickets above; but, as their vision flitted
along the front, they caught the faint suggestions
of the figures of men standing erect and doubtless
intently watching the block-house, from which the
rifles of the Kentuckians had flashed but a short
time before.</p>

<p>Whenever the moon's light was obscured, nothing
but blank darkness met the eye, the line of
stockades themselves vanishing from sight. Once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
one of the warriors moved a few steps to the left,
and Jo Stinger and Ned Preston detected it.</p>

<p>"Why not try another shot?" asked the
Colonel, when the matter was referred to.</p>

<p>"It is too much guess-work: nobody can take
any sort of aim, when it is so dark in the block-house."</p>

<p>"I wonder what their purpose can be," muttered
the Colonel, speaking as much to himself as
to those near him.</p>

<p>"I knows what it am," said Blossom Brown,
who had been drawn to the spot by the firing and
the words he had overheard.</p>

<p>"You do, eh?" remarked the Colonel, looking
toward him in the darkness; "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Dey're comin' to steal de well."</p>

<p>"What will they do with it, after they steal it?"</p>

<p>"Take it off in de woods and hide it, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"They won't have any trouble in preventing <i>us</i>
from stealing it,&mdash;that is certain," observed the
Colonel, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Why can't we dig the well inside the block-house,
as you intended?" asked Ned; "there are
shovels, spades and picks, and I don't suppose it
would take us a great while."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"If we are driven to it, we will make the
attempt; but there is no likelihood that we will
have a chance. All our attention will be required
by the Indians."</p>

<p>"You can set Blossom to work if you wish to,"
said Ned Preston; "he is good for little except
to cut wood and dig. If he worked steadily for
two or three days, he might reach water."</p>

<p>Ned was in earnest with this proposition, and he
volunteered to take his turn with his servant and
the others; but the scheme filled Blossom with
dismay.</p>

<p>"I neber dugged a well," he said, with a contemptuous
sniff; "if I should undertook it, de
well would cave in on me, and den all you folks
would hab to stop fightin' de Injines and go to
diggin' me out agin."</p>

<p>Colonel Preston did not consider the project
feasible just then, and Blossom Brown was relieved
from an anticipation which was anything
but pleasant.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was attentively watching the stockade
where the figures of the Wyandot warriors
were faintly seen. He was greatly mystified to
understand what their object could be in exposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
themselves to such risk, when, so far as he could
judge, there was nothing to be gained by so doing;
but none knew better than did the veteran
that, brave as were these red men, they were not
the ones to face a danger without the reasonable
certainty of acquiring some advantage over an
enemy.</p>

<p>"I will risk a shot anyway," he thought; "for,
though I can't make much of an aim, there is a
chance of doing something. As soon as the moon
comes out, I will see how the varmints will stand
a bullet or two."</p>

<p>So he waited "till the clouds rolled by," but,
as he feared, the straining eye could not catch the
faintest suggestion of a warrior, where several
were visible only a short time before.</p>

<p>They had vanished as silently as the shadows of
the clouds swept across the clearing.</p>

<p>The action of the Indians in this respect was
the cause of all kinds of conjectures and theories,
none of the garrison being able to offer one that
satisfied the others.</p>

<p>Megill believed it was a diversion intended to
cover up some design in another direction. He was
sure that, when the Wyandots made a demonstration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
it would come from some other point altogether.
He, therefore, gave his attention mainly
to the cabins and the clearing in front.</p>

<p>Turner suspected they meant to destroy the
well by filling it up, so that it would be useless
when the supply of water within the block-house
should become exhausted. Precisely how this
filling up was to be done, and wherein the necessity
existed (since the Wyandots could command
the approaches to the water day and night), were
beyond the explanation of the settler.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, the veteran of the company, scouted
these theories, as he did that of the Colonel that
it was a mere reconnoissance, but he would not
venture any guess further than that the mischief
was much deeper than any believed, and that
never was there more necessity of the most unremitting
vigilance.</p>

<p>Megill asserted that some scheme was brewing
in the cabin from which the two warriors emerged,
when they sought to cut off the boys in their run
to the block-house. He had seen lights moving
about, though the ones who carried the torches
took care not to expose themselves to any shot
from the station.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>The silence lasted two hours longer without the
slightest evidence that a living person was within
a mile of the block-house. During that period,
not a glimmer of a light could be detected in the
cabin, there was not a single burning arrow, nor
did so much as a war-whoop or signal pass the
lips of one of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>The keen eyes of Jo Stinger and Ned Preston
failed to catch a glimpse of the shadowy figures
at which they discharged their rifles, and which
caused them so much wonderment and speculation.</p>

<p>But the keen scrutiny that seized every favoring
moment and roamed along the lines of stockades,
further than the ordinary eye could follow, discovered
a thing or two which were not without
their significance.</p>

<p>On the northern and eastern sides a number of
pickets had been removed, leaving several gaps
wide enough to admit the passage of a person.
This required a great deal of hard work, for the
pickets had been driven deep into the earth and
were well secured and braced from the inside.</p>

<p>"They needed men on both sides of the stockade
to do that," said Colonel Preston, "and those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
whom we saw, climbed over, so as to give assistance."</p>

<p>"That's the most sensible idee that's been put
forward," replied Jo Stinger, "and I shouldn't
be s'prised if you was right; but somehow or
other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By gracious! I smell smoke sure as yo's
bo'n!"</p>

<p>Blossom Brown gave several vigorous sniffs
before uttering this alarming exclamation, but the
words had no more than passed his lips, when
every man knew he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>There was smoke in the upper part of the
block-house, and though it could not be seen in
the darkness, yet it was perceptible to the sense
of smell.</p>

<p>Consternation reigned for a few minutes among
the garrison, and there was hurrying to and fro
in the effort to learn the cause of the burning near
them.</p>

<p>The most terrifying cry that can strike the ears
of the sailor or passenger at sea is that of fire,
but no such person could hold the cry in greater
dread than did the garrison, shut in the block-house
and surrounded by fierce American Indians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>The first supposition of Colonel Preston was
that it came from the roof, and springing upon a
chair, he shoved up the trap-doors, one after the
other, to a dangerously high extent. But whatever
might have happened to the other portions
of the structure, the roof was certainly intact.</p>

<p>The next natural belief was that it was caused
by the fire on the hearth in the lower story, and
Colonel Preston and Blossom Brown made all haste
down the ladder. Blossom, indeed, was too hasty,
for he missed one of the rounds and went bumping
and tumbling to the floor, where he set up a
terrific cry, to which no attention was paid amid
the general excitement.</p>

<p>"Here it is! Here's the fire!" suddenly
shouted Ned Preston, in a voice which instantly
brought the others around him.</p>

<p>Ned had done that wise thing to which we have
all been urged many a time and oft: he had "followed
his nose" to the north-east corner of the
block-house, where the vapor was so dense that he
knew the cause must be very near.</p>

<p>It so happened that this very nook was the
least guarded of all. Looking directly downward
through the holes cut in the projecting floor, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
eyes smarted so much from the ascending vapor
that he was forced to rub them vigorously that he
might be able to see.</p>

<p>He could detect nothing but smoke for a minute
or so, and that, of course, made itself manifest
to the sense of smell and touch rather than
to that of sight; but he soon observed, directly
beneath his feet, the red glow of fire itself.
Then it was he uttered the startling cry, which
awoke Mrs. Preston and brought the rest around
him.</p>

<p>Despite the care and skill with which the station
had been guarded by the garrison, all of whom
possessed a certain experience in frontier-life, the
wily Wyandots had not only crept up to the
block-house itself without discovery, but they had
brought sticks, had piled them against the north-east
corner, had set fire to them, and had skulked
away without being suspected by any one of the
sentinels.</p>

<p>The fact seemed incredible, and yet there was
the most convincing evidence before or rather
under their eyes. Jo Stinger gave utterance to
several emphatic expressions, as he made a dash
for the barrel of water, and he was entirely willing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to admit that of all idiots who had ever pretended
to be a sensible man, he was the chief.</p>

<p>But the danger was averted without difficulty.
Two pails of water were carefully poured through
the openings in the floor of the projecting roof,
and every spark of fire was extinguished.</p>

<p>The water added to the density of the vapor. It
set all the inmates coughing and caused considerable
annoyance; but it soon passed away, and,
after a time, the air became comparatively pure
again.</p>

<p>Megill complimented the cunning of the Wyandots,
but Jo insisted that they had shown no
special skill at all: it was the utter stupidity of
himself and friends who had allowed such a
thing to be done under their very noses.</p>

<p>"And, if it hadn't been for that darkey there,"
said he, with all the severity he could command,
"we wouldn't have found it out till this old place
was burned down, and we was scootin' across
the clearin' with the varmints crackin' away
at us."</p>

<p>"De gemman is right," assented Blossom, as he
stopped rubbing the bruises he received from
tumbling through the ladder; "you'll find dat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
it's allers me dat wokes folks up when de lightnin'
am gwine to strike somewhar 'bout yar."</p>

<p>"We won't deny you proper credit," said
Colonel Preston, "though Jo is a little wild in
his statements&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The unimportant remark of Colonel Preston
was bisected by the sharp report of Jo Stinger's
rifle, followed on the instant by a piercing shriek
from some point near the block-house, within the
stockade.</p>

<p>"I peppered him <i>that</i> time!" exclaimed the
veteran; "it's all well enough to crawl into yer
winder, gather all the furniture together and set
fire to it, and then creep out agin, but when it
comes to stealin' the flint and tinder out of your
pocket to do it with, then I'm going to get mad."</p>

<p>When the scout had regained something of his
usual good nature, he explained that he had
scarcely turned to look out, when he actually saw
two of the Wyandots walking directly toward the
heap of smoking brush, as though they intended
to renew the fire. The sight he considered one
of the grossest insults ever offered his intelligence,
and he fired, without waiting till some one could
arrange to shoot the second red man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>With a daring that was scarcely to be wondered
at, the warrior who was unhurt threw his arm
about his smitten companion and hurried to one
of the openings in the stockade, through which he
made his way.</p>

<p>This slight check would doubtless cause the
red men to be more guarded in their movements
against the garrison.</p>

<p>"It has teached them," said the hunter, with
something of his grim humor, "that accidents
may happen, and some of 'em mought get hurt if
they go to looking down the muzzles of our
guns."</p>

<p>All noticed a rather curious change in the
weather. The sky, which had been quite clear
early in the evening, was becoming overcast, and
the clouds hid the moon most of the time. It
remained cold and chilly, and more than one of
the garrison wrapped a blanket around him, while
doing duty at the loopholes.</p>

<p>The cloudiness became so marked, after a brief
while, that the view was much shortened in every
direction. Those at the front of the block-house
could not see the edge of the clearing, where the
Licking flowed calmly on its way to the Ohio.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Those on the north saw first the line of stockades
dissolve into darkness, and then the well-curb
(consisting of a rickety crank and windlass),
grew indistinct until its outlines faded
from sight.</p>

<p>The two cabins to the south loomed up in the
gloom as the hulls of ships are sometimes seen in
the night-time at sea, but the blackness was so
profound, it became oppressive. Within the
block-house, where there was no light of any kind
burning, it was like that of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston could not avoid a certain nervousness
over the attempt of the Wyandots to fire
the building, and, though it failed, he half suspected
it would be repeated.</p>

<p>He descended the ladder and made as careful
an examination as possible, but failed to find anything
to add to his alarm and misgiving. Everything
seemed to be secure: the fastenings of the
doors were such that they might be considered
almost as firm as the solid logs themselves.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, he heard some one
coming down the ladder. "Who's there?" he
asked in an undertone.</p>

<p>"It's Jo&mdash;don't be scart."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not scared; I only wanted to know who
it is; what are you after?"</p>

<p>"I'm going out-doors, right among the varmints."</p>

<p>"What has put that idea in your head?"</p>

<p>"They've been playing their tricks on us long
enough, and now I'm going to show them that Jo
Stinger knows a thing or two as well as them."</p>

<p>Colonel Preston would have sought to dissuade
the veteran from the rash proceeding, had he not
known that it was useless to do so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="s08">A MISHAP AND A SENTENCE.</span></h2>

<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe first pinned the
rattlesnake to the earth with the arrow
which he threw with his deft left hand, then he
flung the reptile from his path and resumed his
delicate and dangerous attempt to creep past the
three Wyandots who were lying against the hank
of the Licking, watching the block-house, now
and then firing a shot at the solid logs, as if to
express their wishes respecting the occupants of
the building.</p>

<p>If the task was almost impossible at first, it
soon became utterly so, as the young Shawanoe
was compelled to admit. The contour of the
bank was such that, after getting by the log, he
would be compelled to approach the warriors so
close that he could touch them with his outstretched
hand. This would have answered at
night, when they were asleep, but he might as
well have attempted to lift himself through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
air as to do it under the circumstances we have
described.</p>

<p>Deerfoot never despaired nor gave up so long
as he held space in which to move. He immediately
repeated the retrograde motion he had used
when confronted by the venomous serpent, his
wish now being to return to the spot from which
he fired the arrow.</p>

<p>The ventures made satisfied him that he had
but one chance in a thousand of escaping capture
and death. He could not move to the right nor
left: it would have been certain destruction to
show himself on the clearing, and equally fatal to
attempt to use the shallow Licking behind him.</p>

<p>There was a remote possibility that the arrowy
messenger which he had sent from his bow had
not been noticed by any of the besieging Wyandots,
and that, as considerable time had already
passed, none of them would come over to where
he was to inquire into the matter.</p>

<p>If they would keep as far away from him as
they were when his friend Ned Preston started on
his desperate run for the block-house, of course
he would be safe. He could wait where he was,
lying flat on the ground, through all the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
hours of the day, until the mantle of night
should give him the chance for which he sighed.</p>

<p>Ah, but for one hour of darkness! His flight
from the point of danger would be but pastime.</p>

<p>The single chance in a thousand was that which
we have named: the remote possibility that none
of the Wyandots would come any nearer to where
he was hugging the river bank.</p>

<p>For a full hour Deerfoot was in suspense, with
a fluttering hope that it might be his fortune to
wait until the sun should climb to the zenith and
sink in the west; for, young as was the Shawanoe,
he had learned the great truth that in the affairs
of this world no push or energy will win, where
the virtue of patience is lacking. Many a time a
single move, born of impatience, has brought
irretrievable disaster, where success otherwise was
certain.</p>

<p>As the Shawanoe lay against the bank, looking
across the clearing toward the block-house, he
recalled that message which, instead of being
spoken, as were all that he knew of, was carried
on the arrow he sent through the window. If he
but understood how to place those words on paper
or on a dried leaf even, he would send another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
missive to Colonel Preston, saying that, inasmuch
as he was shut in from all hope of escape, he
would make the effort to run across the open
space, as did his friends before him.</p>

<p>But the thing was impossible: the door of the
block-house was fastened, and if Deerfoot should
start, he would reach it, if he reached it at all,
before the Colonel could draw the first bolt. Even
if the Shawanoe youth should succeed in making
the point, which was extremely doubtful, now
that the Wyandots were fully awake, the inevitable
few seconds' halt there must prove fatal.</p>

<p>The short conversation which he had overheard,
convinced him of the sentiments of Waughtauk
and his warriors toward him, and led the young
Shawanoe to determine on an effort to extricate
himself. It is the very daring of such a scheme
which sometimes succeeds, and he put it in execution
without delay.</p>

<p>Instead of crouching to the ground, as he had
been doing, he now rose upright and moved down
the bank, in the direction of the three Wyandots
who first turned him back. They were in their
old position, and he had gone only a few steps
when one of them turned his head and saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
youthful warrior approaching. He uttered a
surprised "Hooh!" and the others looked around
at the figure, as they might have done had it been
an apparition.</p>

<p>The scheme of Deerfoot was to attempt the
part of a friend of the Wyandots and consequently
that of an enemy of the white race.
He acted as if without thought of being anything
else, and as though he never dreamed there was a
suspicion of his loyalty.</p>

<p>At a leisurely gait he walked toward the three
Indians, holding his head down somewhat, and
glancing sideways through the scattered bushes at
the top of the bank, as though afraid of a shot
from the garrison.</p>

<p>"Have any of my brethren of the Wyandots
been harmed by the dogs of the Yenghese?"
asked Deerfoot in the high-flown language peculiar
to his people.</p>

<p>"The eyes of Deerfoot must have been closed
not to see Oo-oo-mat-ah lying on the ground
before his eyes."</p>

<p>This was an allusion to the warrior who made
the mistake of stopping Ned Preston when on his
way to the block-house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"Deerfoot saw Oo-oo-mat-ah fall, as falls the
brave warrior fighting his foe; the eyes of Deerfoot
were wet with tears, when his brave Wyandot
brother fell."</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, a microscope would not have
detected the first grain of truth in this grandiloquent
declaration, which was accompanied by a
gesture as though the audacious young Shawanoe
was on the point of breaking into sobs again.</p>

<p>The apparent sincerity of Deerfoot's grief
seemed to disarm the Wyandots for the moment,
which was precisely what the young Shawanoe
was seeking to do.</p>

<p>Having mastered his sorrow, he started down
the river bank on the same slow gait, glancing
sideways at the block-house as though he feared a
shot from that point. But the Indians were not
to be baffled in that fashion: their estimate of the
daring Deerfoot was the same as Waughtauk's.</p>

<p>Without any further dissembling, one of the
Wyandots, a lithe sinewy brave, fully six feet in
height, bounded in front of the Shawanoe, and
grasping his knife, said with flashing eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a dog! he is a traitor; he is a
serpent that has two tongues! he shall die!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>The others stood a few feet behind the couple
and watched the singular encounter.</p>

<p>The Wyandot, with the threatening words in
his mouth, leaped toward Deerfoot, striking a
vicious blow with his knife. It was a thrust
which would have ended the career of the youthful
brave, had it reached its mark.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot dodged it easily, and, without
attempting to return it, shot under the infuriated
arm and sped down the river bank with all the
wonderful speed at his command.</p>

<p>The slight disturbance had brought the other
three Wyandots to the spot, and it would have
been an easy thing to shoot the fugitive as he fled.
But among the new arrivals were those who knew
it was the wish of Waughtauk that Deerfoot
should be taken prisoner, that he might be put to
the death all traitors deserved.</p>

<p>Instead of firing their guns therefore, the whole
six broke into a run, each exerting himself to the
utmost to overtake the fleet-footed youth, who was
no match for any one of them in a hand-to-hand
conflict, or a trial of strength.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, by his sharp strategy, had thrown the
whole party behind him and had gained two or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
three yards' start: he felt that, if he could not
hold this against the fleetest of the Wyandots,
then he deserved to die the death of a dog.</p>

<p>The bushes, undergrowth and logs which obstructed
his path, were as troublesome to his
pursuers as to himself, and he bounded over them
like a mountain chamois, leaping from crag to
crag.</p>

<p>There can be no question that, if this contest
had been decided by the relative swiftness of foot
on the part of pursuer and pursued, the latter
would have escaped without difficulty, but, as if
the fates were against the brave Shawanoe, his
matchless limbs were no more than fairly going,
when two Wyandot warriors appeared directly in
front in such a position that it was impossible to
avoid them.</p>

<p>Deerfoot made a wrenching turn to the right,
as if he meant to flank them, but he stumbled,
nearly recovered himself&mdash;then fell with great
violence, turning a complete somersault from his
own momentum, and then rose to his feet, as the
Indians in front and rear closed around him.</p>

<p>He uttered a suppressed exclamation of pain,
limped a couple of steps, and then grasped a tree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to sustain himself. He seemed to have sprained
his ankle badly and could bear his weight only on
one foot. No more disastrous termination of the
flight could have followed.</p>

<p>The Wyandots gathered about the poor fugitive
with many expressions of pleasure, for the pursuers
had just been forced to believe the young
brave was likely to escape them, and it was a
delightful surprise when the two appeared in
front and headed him off.</p>

<p>Besides, a man with a sprained ankle is the last
one in the world to indulge in a foot-race, and
they felt secure, therefore, in holding their prisoner.</p>

<p>"Dog! traitor! serpent with the forked
tongue! base son of a brave chieftain! warrior
with the white heart!"</p>

<p>These were a few of the expressions applied to
the captive, who made no answer. In fact, he
seemed to be occupied exclusively with his ankle,
for, while they were berating him, he stooped over
and rubbed it with both hands, flinging his long
bow aside, as though it could be of no further use
to him.</p>

<p>The epithets were enough to blister the skin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the ordinary American Indian, and there came a
sudden flush to the dusky face of the youthful
brave, when he heard himself called the base son
of a brave chieftain. But he had learned to conquer
himself, and he uttered not a word in
response.</p>

<p>One of the Wyandots picked up the bow which
the captive had thrown aside, and examined it
with much curiosity. There was no attempt to
disarm him of his knife and tomahawk, for had
he not been disabled by the sprained ankle, he
would have been looked upon as an insignificant
prisoner, against whom it was cowardly to take
any precautions. In fact, to remove his weapons
that remained would have been giving dignity to
one too contemptible to deserve the treatment of
an ordinary captive.</p>

<p>The aborigines, like all barbarians and many
civilized people, are cruel by nature. The Wyandots,
who had secured Deerfoot, refrained from
killing him for no other reason than that it would
have been greater mercy than they were willing to
show to one whom they held in such detestation.</p>

<p>As it was, two of them struck him and repeated
the taunting names uttered when they first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
laid hands on him. Deerfoot still made no answer,
though his dark eyes flashed with a dangerous
light when he looked in the faces of the couple
who inflicted the indignity.</p>

<p>He asked them quietly to help him along, but,
with another taunt, the whole eight refused. The
one who had smote him twice and who held his
bow, placed his hand against the shoulder of the
youth and gave him a violent shove. Deerfoot
went several paces and then fell on his knees and
hands with a gasp of pain severe enough to make
him faint.</p>

<p>The others laughed, as he painfully labored to
his feet. He then asked that he might have his
bow to use as a cane; but even this was refused.
Finding nothing in the way of assistance was to
be obtained, his proud spirit closed his lips, and
he limped forward, scarcely touching the great toe
of the injured limb to the ground.</p>

<p>The brief flight and pursuit had led the parties
so far down the Licking that they were out of
sight of the block-house, quite a stretch of forest
intervening; but it had also taken them nearer the
headquarters, as they may be called, of Waughtauk,
leader of the Wyandots besieging Fort Bridgman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>This sachem showed, in a lesser way, something
of the military prowess of Pontiac, chief of the
Chippewas, King Philip of Pokanoket, and
Tecumseh, who belonged to the same tribe with
Deerfoot.</p>

<p>Although his entire force numbered a little
more than fifty, yet he had disposed them with
such skill around the block-house that the most
experienced of scouts failed to make his way
through the lines.</p>

<p>Waughtauk was well convinced of the treachery
of the Shawanoe, and there was no living man for
whom he would have given a greater amount of
wampum.</p>

<p>The eyes of the chieftain sparkled with pleasure
when the youthful warrior came limping painfully
toward him, escorted by the Wyandots, as though
they feared that, despite his disabled condition, he
might dart off with the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>Waughtauk rose from the fallen tree on which
he had been seated among his warriors, and advanced
a step or two to meet the party as it
approached.</p>

<p>"Dog! base son of the noble chief Allomaug!
youth with the red face and the white heart!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
serpent with the forked tongue! the Great Spirit
has given it to Waughtauk that he should inflict
on you the death that is fitting all such."</p>

<p>These were fierce words, but the absolute fury
of manner which marked their utterance showed
how burning was the hate of the Wyandot leader
and his warriors. They knew that this youth had
been honored and trusted as no one of his years
had ever been honored and trusted by his tribe,
and his treachery was therefore all the deeper, and
deserving of the worst punishment that could be
devised.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, standing on one foot, with his hand
grasping a sapling at his side, looked calmly in the
face of the infuriated leader, and in his low,
musical voice, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Deerfoot was sick almost to death, his
white brother took the place of the father and
mother who went to the happy hunting grounds
long ago; Deerfoot would have been a dog, had
he not helped his white brother through the forest,
when the bear and the panther and the Wyandot
were in his path."</p>

<p>This defence, instead of soothing the chieftain,
seemed to arouse all the ferocity of his nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
His face fairly shone with flame through his
ochre and paint; and striding toward the prisoner,
he raised his hand with such fierceness
that the muscles of the arm rose in knots and
the veins stood out in ridges on temple and
forehead.</p>

<p>As he threw his fist aloft and was on the point
of smiting Deerfoot to the earth, the latter
straightened up with his native dignity, and, still
grasping the sapling and still standing on one
foot, looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>It was as if a great lion-tamer, hearing the
stealthy approach of the wild beast, had suddenly
turned and confronted him.</p>

<p>Waughtauk paused at the moment, his fist was
in the air directly over the head of Deerfoot,
glowering down upon him with an expression
demoniac in its hate. He breathed hard and fast
for a few seconds and then retreated without striking
the impending blow.</p>

<p>But it must not be understood that it was the
defiant look of the captive which checked the
chief. It produced no such effect, nor was it intended
to do so: it simply meant on the part of
Deerfoot that he expected indignity and torture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and death, and he could bear them as unflinchingly
as Waughtauk himself.</p>

<p>As for the chieftain, he reflected that a little
counsel and consultation were needed to fix upon
the best method of putting this tormentor out of
the way. If Waughtauk should allow his own
passion to master him, the anticipated enjoyment
would be lost.</p>

<p>While Deerfoot, therefore, retained his grasp
on the sapling, that he might be supported from
falling, Waughtauk called about him his cabinet,
as it may be termed, and began the consideration
of the best means of punishing the traitor.</p>

<p>The captive could hear all the discussion, and,
it need not be said, he listened with much more
interest than he appeared to feel.</p>

<p>It would be revolting to detail the schemes
advocated. If there is any one direction in which
the human mind is marvelous in its ingenuity, it
is in the single one of devising means of making
other beings miserable. Some of the proposals of
the Wyandots were worthy of Nana Sahib, of
Bithoor, but they were rejected one after the
other, as falling a little short of the requirements
of the leader.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>There was one fact which did not escape the
watchful eye and ear of the prisoner. The Wyandot
who struck him twice, and who had taken
charge of his bow, as a trophy belonging specially
to himself, was the foremost in proposing the
most cruel schemes. The look which Deerfoot
cast upon him said plainly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would give the world for a chance to settle
with <i>you</i> before I suffer death!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought seemed to seize Waughtauk
like an inspiration. Rising to his feet, he held up
his hand for his warriors to listen:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a swift runner; he has overtaken
the fleeing horse and leaped upon his back; he
shall be placed in the Long Clearing; he shall be
given a start, and the swiftest Wyandot warriors
shall be placed in line on the edge of the Long
Clearing; they shall start together, and the scalp
of Deerfoot shall belong to him who first overtakes
him."</p>

<p>This scheme, after all, was merciful when compared
with many that were proposed; but the
staking of a man's life on his fleetness, when
entirely unable to run, is an idea worthy of an
American Indian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="s08">AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.</span></h2>

<p>Jo Stinger had decided to venture out from
the block-house, at a time when the Wyandots
were on every side, and when many of them were
within the stockade and close to the building
itself It was a perilous act, but the veteran had
what he deemed good grounds for undertaking it.</p>

<p>In the first place, the darkness had deepened to
that extent, within the last few hours, that he
believed he could move about without being suspected:
he was confident indeed that he could
stay out as long as he chose and return in safety.</p>

<p>He still felt chagrined over the audacity of the
Wyandots, which came so near success, and
longed to turn the tables upon them.</p>

<p>But Jo Stinger had too much sense to leave the
garrison and run into great peril without the prospect
of accomplishing some good thereby. He
knew the Wyandots were completing preparations
to burn the block-house. He believed it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
be attempted before morning, and, if not detected
by him, would succeed. He had strong hope that,
by venturing outside, he could learn the nature of
the plan against which it would therefore be possible
to make some preparation.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston was not without misgiving
when he drew the ponderous bolts, but he gave
no expression to his thoughts. All was blank
darkness, but, when the door was drawn inward,
he felt several cold specks on his hand, from which
he knew it was snowing.</p>

<p>The flakes were very fine and few, but they
were likely to increase before morning, by which
time the ground might be covered.</p>

<p>"When shall I look for your return?" asked
the Colonel, but, to his surprise, there was no answer.
Jo had moved away, and was gone without
exchanging another word with the commandant.</p>

<p>The latter refastened the door at once. He
could not but regard the action of the most valuable
man of his garrison as without excuse: at
the same time he reflected that his own title
could not have been more empty, for no one of the
three men accepted his orders when they conflicted
with his personal views.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime Jo Stinger, finding himself on
the outside of the block-house, was in a situation
where every sense needed to be on the alert, and
none knew it better than he.</p>

<p>The door which Colonel Preston opened was
the front one, being that which the scout passed
through the previous night, and which opened on
the clearing along the river. He was afraid that,
if he emerged from the other entrance, he would
step among the Wyandots and be recognized
before he could take his bearings.</p>

<p>But Jo felt that he had entered on an enterprise
in which the chances were against success,
and in which he could accomplish nothing except
by the greatest risk to himself. The listening
Colonel fancied he heard the sound of his stealthy
footstep, as the hunter moved from the door of
the block-house. He listened a few minutes
longer, but all was still except the soft sifting of
the snow against the door, like the finest particles
of sand and dust filtering through the tree-tops.</p>

<p>The Colonel passed to the narrow window at
the side and looked out. It had become like the
blackness of darkness, and several of the whirling
snow-flakes struck his face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>"The Wyandots are concocting some mischief,
and there's no telling what shape it will take until
it comes. I don't believe Jo will do anything that
will help us."</p>

<p>And with a sigh the speaker climbed the
ladder again and told his friends how rash the
pioneer had been.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have allowed him to go," said Ned
Preston.</p>

<p>"There's no stopping him when he has made
up his mind to do anything."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you took him by de collar," asked
Blossom Brown, "and slam him down on de
floor? Dat's what I'd done, and, if he'd said
anyting, den I'd took him by de heels and banged
his head agin de door till he'd be glad to sot down
and behave himself."</p>

<p>"Jo is a skilled frontiersman," said the Colonel,
who felt that it was time he rallied to the defence
of the scout; "he has tramped hundreds of miles
with Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone, and, if his
gun hadn't flashed fire one dark night last winter,
he would have ended the career of Simon
Girty."</p>

<p>"How was that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"Simon Girty and Kenton served together as
spies in Dunmore's expedition in 1774, and up to
that time Girty was a good soldier, who risked
much for his country. He was badly used by
General Lewis, and became the greatest scourge
we have had on the frontier. I don't suppose he
ever has such an emotion as pity in his breast,
and there is no cruelty that he wouldn't be glad
to inflict on the whites. He and Jo know and
hate each other worse than poison. Last winter,
Jo crept into one of the Shawanoe towns one dark
night, and when only a hundred feet away, aimed
straight at Girty, who sat on a log, smoking his
pipe, and talking to several warriors. Jo was so
angered when his gun flashed in the pan, that he
threw it upon the ground and barely saved himself
by dashing out of the camp at the top of his
speed. Jo has been in a great many perilous
situations," added Colonel Preston, "and he can
tell of many a thrilling encounter in the depths
of the silent forest and on the banks of the lonely
streams, where no other human eyes saw him and
his foe."</p>

<p>"No doubt of all that," replied Ned, who knew
that he was speaking the sentiments of his uncle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
"but it seems to me he is running a great deal
more risk than he ought to."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, but we have been greatly
favored so far, and we will continue to hope for
the best."</p>

<p>The long spell of quiet which had followed the
attempt to fire the block-house, permitted the
children to sleep, and their mother, upon the
urgency of her husband, had lain down beside
them and was sinking into a refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>Megill and Turner kept their places at the loopholes,
watching for the signs of danger with as
vigilant interest as though it was the first hour
of the alarm. They were inclined to commend
the course of Jo Stinger, despite the great peril
involved.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, beyond question, were perfecting
some scheme of attack, which most likely
could be foiled only by previous knowledge on the
part of the garrison. The profound darkness and
the skill of the hunter would enable him to do all
that could be done by any one, under the circumstances.</p>

<p>There came seconds, and sometimes minutes,
when no one spoke, and the silence within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
block-house was so profound that the faint sifting
of the snow on the roof was heard. Then an
eddy of wind would whirl some of the sand-like
particles through the loopholes into the eyes and
faces of those who were peering out. Men and
boys gathered their blankets closer about their
shoulders, and set their muskets down beside
them, where they could be caught up the instant
needed, while they carefully warmed their benumbed
fingers by rubbing and striking the palms
together.</p>

<p>All senses were concentrated in the one of
listening, for no other faculty was of avail at such
a time. Nerves were strung to the highest point,
because there was not one who did not feel certain
they were on the eve of events which were to
decide the fate of the little company huddled together
in Fort Bridgman.</p>

<p>This stillness was at its profoundest depth, the
soft rustling of the snowflakes seemed to have
ceased, and not a whisper was on the lips of one
of the garrison, when there suddenly rang out on
the night a shriek like that of some strong man
caught in the crush of death. It was so piercing
that it seemed almost to sound from the center of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the room, and certainly must have been very close
to the block-house itself.</p>

<p>"That was the voice of Jo!" said Colonel
Preston, in a terrified undertone, after a minute's
silence; "he has met his fate."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," Megill hastened to say;
"I have been with Jo too often, and I know his
voice too well to be deceived."</p>

<p>"It sounded marvelously like his."</p>

<p>"It did not to me, though it may have been so
to you."</p>

<p>"If it was not Jo, then it must have been one
of the Wyandots."</p>

<p>"That follows, as a matter of course; in spite
of all of Jo's care, he has run against one of their
men, or one of them has run against him. The
only way to settle it then was in the hurricane
order, and Jo has done it that promptly that the
other has just had time to work in a first-class
yell like that."</p>

<p>"I'm greatly relieved to hear you take such a
view," said Colonel Preston, who, like the rest,
was most agreeably disappointed to hear Megill
speak so confidently, his brother-in-law adding his
testimony to the same effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>"Directly after that shriek," said Turner, "I'm
sure there was the tramping of feet, as if some
one was running very fast: it passed under the
stockade and out toward the well."</p>

<p>"I heard the footsteps too," added Ned
Preston.</p>

<p>"So did I," chimed in Blossom Brown, feeling
it his duty to say something to help the others
along; "but I'm suah dat de footsteps dat I
heerd war on de roof. Some onrespectful Wyamdot
hab crawled up dar, and I bet am lookin'
down de chimbley dis minute."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," observed Ned to his uncle,
"that Jo will want to come back pretty soon."</p>

<p>"I think so too," replied his uncle, "I will go
down-stairs and wait for him."</p>

<p>With these words he descended the rounds of
the ladder and moved softly across the lower floor
to the door, where he paused, with his hands on
one of the heavy bars which held the structure in
place.</p>

<p>While crossing the room he looked toward the
fire-place. Among the ashes he caught the sullen
red of a single point of fire, like the glowering eye
of some ogre, watching him in the darkness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>Beside the huge latch, there were three ponderous
pieces of timber which spanned the inner
side of the door, the ends dropping into massive
sockets strong enough to hold the puncheon slabs
against prodigious pressure from the outside.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston carefully lifted the upper one
out of place and then did the same with the
lowest. Then he placed his hand on the middle
bar and held his ear close to the jamb, so that he
might catch the first signal from the scout, whose
return was due every minute.</p>

<p>The listening ear caught the silken sifting of
the particles of snow, which insinuated themselves
into and through the smallest crevices, and a slight
shiver passed through the frame of the pioneer,
who had thrown his blanket off his shoulders so
that he might have his arms free to use the instant
it should become necessary.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston had stood thus only a few minutes,
when he fancied he heard some one on the
outside. The noise was very slight and much as
if a dog was scratching with his paw. Knowing
that wood is a better conductor of sound than
air, he pressed his ear against the door.</p>

<p>To his astonishment he then heard nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
except the snowflakes, which sounded like the tapping
of multitudinous fairies, as they romped
back and forth and up and down the door.</p>

<p>"That's strange," thought he, after listening a
few minutes; "there's something unusual out
there, and I don't know whether it is Jo or not.
I'm afraid the poor fellow has been hurt and is
afraid to make himself known."</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when he
caught a faint tapping outside, as if made by the
bill of a bird.</p>

<p>"That's Jo!" he exclaimed, immediately raising
the end of the middle bar from its socket;
"he must be hurt, or he is afraid to signal me,
lest he be recognized."</p>

<p>At the moment the fastenings were removed,
and Colonel Preston was about drawing the door
inward, he stayed his hand, prompted so to do by
the faintest suspicion that something was amiss.</p>

<p>"Jo! is that you?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"<i>Sh! Sh!</i>"</p>

<p>He caught the warning, almost inaudible as it
was, and instantly drew the door inward six or
eight inches.</p>

<p>"Quick, Jo! the way is open!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>Even then a vague suspicion that all was not
right led Colonel Preston to step back a single
step, and, though he had no weapons, he clenched
his fist and braced himself for an assault which he
did not expect.</p>

<p>The darkness was too complete for him to see
anything, while the faint ember, smouldering in
the fire-place, threw no reflection on the figure of
the pioneer, so as to reveal his precise position.</p>

<p>It was a providential instinct that led Colonel
Preston to take this precaution, for as he recoiled
some one struck a venomous blow at him with a
knife, under the supposition that he was standing
on the same spot where he stood at the moment
the door was opened. Had he been there, he
would have been killed with the suddenness almost
of the lightning stroke.</p>

<p>The pioneer could not see, and he heard nothing
except a sudden expiration of the breath, which
accompanied the fierce blow into vacancy, but he
knew like a flash that, instead of Jo, it was a
Wyandot Indian who was in the act of making a
rush to open the way for the other warriors behind
him.</p>

<p>The right fist shot forward, with all the power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Colonel Preston could throw into it. He was an
athlete and a good boxer. As he struck, he hurled
his body with the fist, so that all the momentum
possible went with it. Fortunately for the pioneer
the blow landed on the forehead of the unprepared
warrior, throwing him violently backward against
his comrades, who were in the act of rushing forward
to follow in his wake.</p>

<p>But for them he would have been flung prostrate
full a dozen feet distant.</p>

<p>The instant the blow was delivered, Colonel
Preston sprang back, shoved the door to and
caught up the middle bar. At such crises it seems
as if fate throws every obstruction in the way, and
his agony was indescribable, while desperately trying
to get the bar in place.</p>

<p>Only a few seconds were occupied in doing so,
but those seconds were frightful ones to him. He
was sure the entire war party would swarm into
the block-house, before he could shut them out.</p>

<p>The Indians, who were forced backward by the
impetus of the smitten leader, understood the
need of haste. They knew that, unless they recovered
their ground immediately, their golden
opportunity was gone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>Suppressing all outcry, for they had no wish to
draw the fire from the loopholes above, they precipitated
themselves against the door, as though
each one was the carved head of a catapult, equal
to the task of bursting through any obstacle in
its path.</p>

<p>Thank Heaven! In the very nick of time Colonel
Preston got the middle bar into its socket. This
held the door so securely that the other two were
added without trouble, and he then breathed freely.</p>

<p>Drops of cold perspiration stood on his forehead,
and he felt so faint that he groped about for a
stool, on which he dropped until he could recover.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="s08">OUT-DOORS ON A DARK NIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>In the meantime Jo Stinger, the veteran frontiersman,
had not found the "plain sailing"
which he anticipated.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that he passed out upon
the clearing in front of the block-house, because
he feared that, if he entered the yard inclosed by
the stockade, he would find himself among the
Wyandots, who would be quick to detect his
identity.</p>

<p>His presence immediately in front of the
structure would also draw attention to himself,
and he therefore glided away until he was fully
a hundred feet distant, when he paused close to
the western pickets.</p>

<p>Looking behind him, he could not see the outlines
of the building which he had just left. For
the sake of safety Colonel Preston allowed no
light burning within the block-house, which itself
was like a solid bank of darkness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be easy enough now for me to make
my way to Wild Oaks," reflected Stinger; "for,
when the night is like this, three hundred Indians
could not surround the old place close enough to
catch any one crawling through. But it is no use
for me to strike out for the Ohio now, for the boys
could not get here soon enough to affect the result
one way or the other. Long before that the varmints
will wind up this bus'ness, either by going
away, or by cleaning out the whole concern."</p>

<p>Jo Stinger unquestionably was right in this
conclusion, but he possessed a strong faith that
Colonel Preston and the rest of them in the block-house
would be able to pull through, if they displayed
the vigilance and care which it was easy to
display: this faith explains how it was the frontiersman
had ventured upon what was, beyond all
doubt, a most perilous enterprise.</p>

<p>Jo, from some cause or other which he could
not explain, suspected the Wyandots were collecting
near the well, and he began working his way
in that direction.</p>

<p>It was unnecessary to scale the stockade, and
he therefore moved along the western side, until
he reached the angle, when he turned to the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
and felt his way parallel with the northern line of
pickets.</p>

<p>Up to this time he had not caught sight or
sound to show that an Indian was within a mile
of him. The fine particles of snow made themselves
manifest only by the icy, needle-like points
which touched his face and hands, as he groped
along. He carried his faithful rifle in his left
hand, and his right rested on the haft of his long
hunting-knife at his waist. His head was thrust
forward, while he peered to the right and left,
advancing with as much care as if he were entering
a hostile camp on a moonlight night, when
the overturning of a leaf is enough to awaken a
score of sleeping red men.</p>

<p>A moment after passing the corner of the
stockade something touched his elbow. He knew
on the instant that it was one of the Wyandots.
In the darkness they had come thus close without
either suspecting the presence of the other.</p>

<p>"Hooh! my brother is like Deerfoot, the dog
of a Shawanoe."</p>

<p>This was uttered in the Wyandot tongue, and
the scout understood the words, but he did not
dare reply. He could not speak well enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
deceive the warrior, who evidently supposed he was
one of his own people.</p>

<p>But there was the single exclamation which he
could imitate to perfection, and he did so as he
drew his knife.</p>

<p>"Hooh!" he responded, moving on without the
slightest halt. The response seemed satisfactory
to the Wyandot, but could Jo have seen the
actions of the Indian immediately after, he would
have felt anything but secure on that point.</p>

<p>The brave stood a minute or so, looking in the
direction taken by the other, and then, as if suspicious
that all was not what it seemed, he followed
after the figure which had vanished so
quickly.</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal if I but knowed what
he meant by speaking of Deerfoot as he did,"
said Jo to himself, "but I didn't dare ask him to
give the partic'lars. I make no doubt they've
catched the Shawanoe and scalped him long
ago."</p>

<p>Remembering the openings which he had seen
in the stockade before the darkness became so
intense, Jo reached out his right hand and run it
along the pickets, so as not to miss them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>He had gone only a little way, when his touch
revealed the spot where a couple had been removed,
and there was room for him to force his
body through.</p>

<p>Jo was of a spare figure, and, with little difficulty,
he entered the space inclosed by the
stockade. He now knew his surroundings and
bearings, as well as though it were high noon, and
began making his way with great stealth in the
direction of the well standing near the middle of
the yard.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, the Wyandot with
whom he had exchanged salutations was stealing
after him: it was the old case of the hunter going
to hunt the tiger, and soon finding the tiger was
hunting him.</p>

<p>The task of the Wyandot, however, for the
time, was a more delicate one than was the white
man's, for the dusky pursuer had lost sight of his
foe (if indeed it can be said he had ever caught a
view of him), instantly after the brief salutation
between them.</p>

<p>The warrior, when he reached the first opening
in the stockade, had no means of knowing that
the pale-face had passed through. Had there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
been any daylight to aid his vision, he could have
learned the truth at once; but if there had been
daylight, there could have been no such necessity,
inasmuch as Jo Stinger would have stayed in the
block-house.</p>

<p>The fact that he could not trace the daring
scout with any certainty, did not deprive the Wyandot
of the ability to do something for himself
and companions.</p>

<p>When Jo Stinger passed within the stockade,
he fixed the direction in which lay the well, and
then began advancing toward it. The result of
this venture proved again, how often the most
careful preparation is defeated by some simple
obstruction against which a child ought to have
guarded.</p>

<p>"I must be pretty near the spot," thought Jo,
when he had groped vaguely for some distance;
"I can't imagine what the varmints can be doin'
here, but they've got some plan on foot which I'm
bound&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this instant, with a shock which made his
hair fairly rise on end, he stepped directly into the
well and went down!</p>

<p>The rickety inclosure of slabs, with the crank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
and windlass, had been removed by the Wyandots,
so that in case any of the garrison ventured out,
under cover of darkness, to get water, they would
be unable to do so.</p>

<p>The theft of the curb, bucket, and appliances,
shut off the supply from that source as utterly as
though it had never existed. And yet, not a
single member of the garrison, knowing as they
did that the Wyandots were carrying out some
design, suspected what their real purpose was.</p>

<p>Providence alone saved Jo Stinger from an
ignominious end, for had he gone to the bottom
of the well, the Indians could not have failed to
discover it, and they would have carried out their
own will concerning him.</p>

<p>But the life of peril which Jo had led so many
years, greatly developed a certain readiness and
presence of mind natural to him; but it was
probably the instinctive desire to catch himself,
which led him on the instant to place the gun in
his left hand in a horizontal position. The diameter
of the well was much less than the length of
the old-fashioned flint-lock rifle; and thus it came
about that muzzle and stock caught firmly, and
Jo was suspended in the middle of the opening by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
one hand. Hastily shoving his knife back in his
girdle, he seized the barrel with both hands and
easily drew himself from his dangerous position.
Then he took out his knife again and indulged in
an expression of opinion concerning his performances
of the last twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>This opinion it is not necessary to place on
record: the reader need not be told that it was
the reverse of complimentary, and that it would
have hardly been safe for any one else to repeat
the same vigorous comments in the presence of Jo
himself.</p>

<p>He was not without gratitude for his delivery
from the consequences of his own carelessness,
but he was exasperated beyond expression by the
stupidity which had seemed to brood over the
counsels of the garrison from the first and to
direct everything done.</p>

<p>While a prey to this gnawing chagrin, he suddenly
became aware that one of the Wyandots
was at his elbow again.</p>

<p>"My brother treads like the shadows of the
clouds which sweep over the forest: there is no
sound, and he glides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is his style of gliding," interrupted Jo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Stinger, who was in a most dangerous mood, as
he bounded like a panther toward him.</p>

<p>The grapple was short and terrific: there was
one wild piercing shriek from the dusky foeman,
and then it was all over. Jo hurried from the
spot, for he knew others would be there in a few
seconds, and they would be quick to detect or at
least to surmise the truth.</p>

<p>He hastened back over the path by which he
had approached the well, passing through the
same opening that had admitted him. Then, with
a view of avoiding any one who might be using the
same route, he moved a rod or two away from the
stockade, turning the corner nearly as before and
starting on his return to the block-house.</p>

<p>Jo's belief was that he could accomplish nothing
more by staying outside the building. He
had learned that about the well which he ought
to have known long before, and the Wyandots
had already ascertained that one of the garrison,
or possibly some friend from another point, was
on the outside. They would take precaution
against his entering the block-house, and doubtless
would exert themselves to detect and slay
him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>He felt therefore that it would not do to delay
his return. He did not do so, and yet, quick as he
was, he made the discovery after all that he was
just too late. Approaching the door of the building
with extreme caution, it did not take him long
to learn that the Wyandots were there before
him.</p>

<p>He withdrew with the same care, and continued
stealing some distance further in a southern
direction, finally halting close to the cabin from
which the Wyandots had issued when they interfered
with the flight of Blossom Brown and Ned
Preston across the clearing.</p>

<p>Jo felt the situation was becoming serious.
He had not thought of anything like this, and
he had made no arrangement for a system of
signals to meet the difficulty. Colonel Preston
would detect his low, tremulous whistle, by
which the scout was accustomed to make known
his presence on the outside and his desire to
enter; but there was no means of apprising the
Colonel of the alarming fact that a number of
Indians were waiting in the darkness to take his
place.</p>

<p>Had Jo thought of all this beforehand, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
would have been no such startling occurrence at
the door, as has been described.</p>

<p>He did not believe it probable the Wyandots
would emit any signals which would deceive
Colonel Preston into the belief that it was a
friend and not an enemy who was asking admission
into the station.</p>

<p>While the pioneer stood aloof in the darkness,
debating and asking himself what was best to do,
his keen vision was able to mark the shape of
something which puzzled him only for the
moment. It was a parallelogram of a faint
yellow glow only a short distance in front of
him.</p>

<p>"That comes from a light in the cabin, where
them varmints have been loafing ever since the
rumpus yesterday morning."</p>

<p>Jo was right in this supposition: he had approached
the dwelling, wherein were several Wyandots
who had a fire burning on the hearth.
The yellow reflection showing through one of the
side-windows led Jo to detect its meaning with
scarce a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>As yet he had succeeded in learning nothing of
importance, for no one would attempt to draw any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
water from the well during the night, and if the
block-house should remain on its foundations
until morning, every one of the garrison could see
for himself that the supply was no longer available.</p>

<p>What secret might not the old cabin give up to
him? Was it not there that he should seek the
key to the problem which had baffled him thus
far?</p>

<p>These and similar questions Jo Stinger put to
himself, as he advanced toward the structure
wherein he was certain to find more than one
Wyandot.</p>

<p>As his approach was from the side instead of
the front, as it may be called (by which is meant
that part of the cabin which faced the block-house
itself), the red men within had taken no precautions
against observation from that direction.</p>

<p>While Jo was yet ten feet from the window, he
gained a view of the interior that showed everything
in the room, with whose contour he was
familiar. The sight which met his gaze was a
most interesting one indeed.</p>

<p>There were three Indians seated, cross-legged
like Turks, on the floor, smoking their pipes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
while they talked earnestly together. One of
these, from his dress and manner, Jo knew was
the chief or leader of the war party. It was, in
fact, Waughtauk who was holding a consultation
with his two lieutenants, if they may be termed
such, on the "conduct of the war."</p>

<p>Jo Stinger had no doubt that such was their
occupation, and he was certain that, if he could
overhear their words, he was likely to gather the
very information he was seeking.</p>

<p>As we have already intimated, he understood
the Wyandot tongue, and he was eager to catch
the expressions, especially those which fell from
the lips of the chief himself.</p>

<p>"The pale-faces will come from the Ohio,"
were the first words which Stinger was able to
hear, and they were uttered by Waughtauk himself;
"if we wait until to-morrow, they will be
here before nightfall."</p>

<p>This implied rather rapid traveling on the part
of the party of rescue from Wild Oaks, and it
was more than likely that the chief, with a view
of adding force to his remarks, exaggerated matters
to a certain extent.</p>

<p>"One of the Yenghese is abroad to-night," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the warrior next the chief. As he spoke, he took
his pipe from his mouth and used it in gesticulating;
"he has slain one of our braves."</p>

<p>"He shall die for his offence, as all the Yenghese
shall die," replied the chieftain, in a voice so loud
that the listener could have caught his meaning
had he been a rod further away. "None of them
shall see the sun rise again. They shall be burned
in the block-house, which has encumbered our
hunting-grounds too long."</p>

<p>This threat was only what might have been
expected, but Waughtauk the next minute imparted
the very tidings which Jo Stinger sought,
and for the sake of which he had risked so much.</p>

<p>"The wind blows strong; the Great Spirit will
soon fan the fire into a blaze, and will carry it
from this cabin to the block-house."</p>

<p>There it was!</p>

<p>The whole scheme was laid bare to the scout in
the last sentence spoken by the Wyandot chieftain.
The wind was setting in strongly from the south,
that is, from the building in which the three warriors
gathered, directly toward the block-house.</p>

<p>Should the former be fired, the probability was
the gale would carry the sparks to the other and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
set that in a blaze, in which event there would be
scarcely an earthly hope left for a single one of
the inmates.</p>

<p>Jo had heard enough, and his wish now was to
get back to his friends with the least possible
delay, that they might make preparation against
the assault that could not be postponed much
longer.</p>

<p>Knowing the superstition of the American
Indian, the scout now resorted to an artifice as
daring as it was startling. Although a man
trained in border-warfare, accustomed to the
frightful cruelties of the aborigines, and knowing
the fierce purposes of the Wyandots surrounding
Fort Bridgman, he could not bring himself to the
point of deliberately shooting down one or more
of the conspirators, who, in point of fact, were at
his mercy.</p>

<p>Many a brave hunter or pioneer, placed in his
situation, would have seized the opportunity to
shoot the chieftain himself while sitting in the
cabin, unsuspicious of his danger; but Jo Stinger
was not of such a disposition.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i248" id="i248"></a>
<img src="images/i-248.jpg" width="550" height="393" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Joe Stinger puts in an Appearance.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Raising his long rifle to his shoulder, he pointed
it straight at Waughtauk, and then advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
until the muzzle was thrust through the window,
while he himself stood no more than a foot outside.</p>

<p>At that instant one of the warriors reached
down and stirred the blazing sticks of wood burning
on the hearth. The flames leaped higher,
filling the room with a warm ruddy glow. A
slight noise caused the three Wyandots to turn
their heads toward the open window, when they
saw a sight which held them spell-bound.</p>

<p>A tall spare man, in the garb of a hunter, stood
with his deadly rifle pointed straight at them, and
the muzzle was not twelve feet distant from the
head of Waughtauk the chief.</p>

<p>Looking along the barrel, pointing like the
finger of fate at the Wyandot leader, the bony
fingers of the left hand were seen grasping the
dark iron, while the right hand, crooked at the
elbow, encompassed the trigger-guard, and the
forefinger was gently pressing the trigger. The
hammer clutching the yellow flint was drawn far
back, like the jaw of a rattlesnake when about to
bury its fangs in its victim, and just behind that
the single open eye of the hunter himself seemed
to be agleam with a fire that was likely to ignite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the powder in the pan, without the flash of the
quartz.</p>

<p>The coonskin cap, the grizzly whiskers, the
rough garments were frosted with tiny snowflakes
which glistened and glinted in the fire-light like
points of burnished silver. The figure was as
motionless as were the three Wyandots, who could
only stare at what must have seemed an apparition
from the other world. As they gazed, the figure
spoke in a slow sepulchral voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the Wyandot chieftain and his warriors
go back to their squaws and pappooses, for the
pale-face is hurrying through the forest to burn
his lodges and to make captive his children! The
Great Spirit commands that the Wyandots shall
go."</p>

<p>Having uttered these extraordinary words, Jo
Stinger took several steps backward, without moving
a muscle of the upper portion of his body, so
silently and imperceptibly that he seemed to dissolve
in the surrounding darkness.</p>

<p>The moment after, Waughtauk uttered a cry of
such distress that the Wyandots in the immediate
neighborhood heard it and hurried to him. Stinger
was quick to perceive his chance, and hurrying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the door of the block-house, he rapped so sharply
on it that the listening Colonel Preston hurried
down the ladder and approached the entrance.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked the commandant, in a
guarded voice.</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;Jo; it's all right; quick, let me in afore
the varmints get back!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the voice, and Colonel
Preston removed the fastenings with a nervous
haste, which did not leave him until his friend
was inside, and the bars were replaced in their
sockets.</p>

<p>He then grasped the hand of Jo and shook it
warmly, for the relief of all over the return of
the invaluable scout was beyond expression. They
hurriedly went up the ladder, where all, including
Mrs. Preston, who declared she could sleep no more
that night, listened to the stirring story which Jo
had to tell. His auditors fairly held their breath
when he drew the picture of himself standing at
the window of the cabin, with his rifle pointed at
the Wyandot chief, and commanding him in the
name of the Great Spirit to hasten to protect his
own lodges from the invading white man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"You gave him such a fright that he may
strike his tents and leave," suggested Colonel
Preston.</p>

<p>"No," said Jo; "such things have been done,
and Simon Kenton once played the trick so well
that he kept a party of Delawares from massacreing
a white family going down the Ohio, but Kenton
had a much better show than me."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Jo, you had everything in
your favor," said Megill, who, like all the others,
was deeply interested in the narrative of the
hunter.</p>

<p>"There's just the trouble; the chief and his
men were scared out of their moccasins for a minute
or so, and if it had happened that I hadn't
showed myself afore, and the Wyandots didn't
know I was outside, the scare might have
amounted to something; but when the other
warriors come around the chief, and he learns
what has took place&mdash;if he didn't know it all
before&mdash;he'll see that the whole thing was a trick,
and he will be madder than ever. I think he'll
open the music agin very soon."</p>

<p>"If he fires the cabin," said Colonel Preston,
"it will be apt to make it pretty warm in here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
for the wind does come from that direction, and I
wish the thing didn't stand quite so near us as it
does. But the sides of the block-house are not
so dry as the roof, and I hope we can stand
more heat from <i>that</i> source than the Wyandots
think."</p>

<p>"We have considerable water left," said Jo,
"and we must take mighty good care that none
of it is wasted."</p>

<p>"Did you find the tomahawk in the door?"
asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I felt for it, but it was gone."</p>

<p>The prospects were discussed in low, earnest
tones, while every one was in a fever of expectancy.
There was constant peeping through the loopholes,
and the occasional whistling and whooping
were accepted as signals to open the last decisive
attack.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was moving about in this manner,
doing what he could to cheer his friends, when
some one caught his elbow.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked, stopping short.</p>

<p>"It is I, Ned Preston," replied the boy; "I
want to ask you a question."</p>

<p>"Well, younker, what is it?" said the hunter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
in a kindly manner, and lowering his voice, so
that the others could not overhear them.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you whether you learned anything
about Deerfoot, when you were out."</p>

<p>"Nothing partic'lar; I heard his name mentioned
by that varmint that run against me, after
I didn't fall into the well."</p>

<p>"How was it?"</p>

<p>Jo related the incident in which he was compared
to the young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"What do you think about it, Jo?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course none of us knows anything for
sartin,&mdash;but it's my opinion&mdash;since you ax it&mdash;that
Deerfoot has slid under for good."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," said Ned Preston faintly.
"Poor Deerfoot!"

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="s08">THE LONG CLEARING.</span></h2>

<p>Deerfoot, the young Shawanoe, despite his
extraordinary exertions and his own wonderful
woodcraft, had fallen into the hands of the
hostile Wyandots, and with a grim satire upon
the skill which had given the youth his great
fame, Waughtauk, chief of his enemies, had decreed
that his life should be staked upon the
result of a race with the fleetest runners of the
tribe.</p>

<p>The captive would have welcomed such a contest,
could it have been conducted on anything
like equal terms, but he seemed in a pitiable condition,
unable to bear the weight of his body for
more than a second on one foot. Had it been
otherwise, Waughtauk never would have made the
conditions what they were.</p>

<p>The promised enjoyment was so eagerly looked
for by the warriors that the chief decided to
gratify them and himself, without delay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>It was now near noon, and the sun shining
overhead gave no indications of the clouds and
snow-fall that came with the close of day. The
"Long Clearing," of which the chief spoke, was
an open space, beginning fifty rods north of the
block-house and extending for a third of a mile,
parallel with the Licking river. It had a width
varying from a hundred feet to five times that
extent. It was a natural clearing or opening,
which, it would seem, offered a much better site
for a block-house than the one selected by Colonel
Preston, when he erected the building now placed
in such danger.</p>

<p>It presented an open space for the distance
named, and, before the founding of the settlement,
was often used by Indians for their games and
athletic contests: no more suitable place could
have been found for the extraordinary contest
decreed by Waughtauk, chief of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>As this exhibition was ordered during the time
when the siege was to be maintained, it was impossible
that more than a fractional part of the
warriors could take part in or witness it. Waughtauk
selected six of his men who were to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
actors in the tragedy, he himself purposing to be
the leader and director.</p>

<p>As the wolf, before destroying the lamb, sought
a pretext for his cruelty, so the chief assumed a
certain air of justice in arranging for what might
be termed a race for life.</p>

<p>The warrior who had struck Deerfoot was given
his bow, the youth being allowed to retain his
knife, tomahawk, and quiver. None of the Wyandots
were permitted to carry their guns,
the only weapon of that kind being in the
hands of the chief, who was also magnanimous
enough to give the fugitive a start of some fifty
yards.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was too proud to open his lips, when
the conditions were explained to him. He stood
grim and silent, watching the preparations and
noting the exultation which often reached boisterousness.</p>

<p>"Great is Deerfoot, the swiftest runner of the
Shawanoes!" said one mockingly; "he is the
eagle, and he will leave the Wyandots far out of
sight, as the great bird leaves the smaller ones in
his flight through the heavens!"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is the friend of the Yenghese and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the Long Knives, who have come to take away
the hunting-grounds of the red man."</p>

<p>"The pale-faces will come to the help of Deerfoot,
for who has been a better friend to them
than he?"</p>

<p>These and similar taunts fell upon ears which
appeared to hear them not. Those who uttered
the cruel words came close to the youth and
peered into his face, with hideous grimaces, but
he stood calm and silent. He was a shade paler,
and there was a strange gleam in his black eyes,
but he looked beyond his tormentors at Waughtauk,
who deliberately paced off the distance,
giving liberal measure, as it is only justice to
record.</p>

<p>When the fifty steps had been taken, Waughtauk
stopped, stamped the heel of his moccasin in
the earth, and, turning about, beckoned to Deerfoot
to approach. The young Shawanoe, as he
hobbled painfully forward, presented a spectacle
which ought to have excited the pity of the
hardest heart; but the Wyandots laughed and
were impatient for the contest, if such it may be
called, to open.</p>

<p>Deerfoot limped the greater part of the distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
and then stopped to rest a moment, seemingly unable
to advance another step. Several taunting
exclamations followed this display of weakness,
and, summoning his energies, the youth resumed
his labored advance, finally reached the side of
Waughtauk, who concealed, as well as he could,
his impatience.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will stand <i>here</i>," said he, pointing to
the indentation the heel of his moccasin had made
in the ground; "when he hears Waughtauk give
forth the war-whoop of the Wyandots, he will
teach my warriors how to run."</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe opened his lips to make
answer, but they closed more tightly than before,
and not a word was uttered. His self-restraint
was perfect.</p>

<p>Waughtauk walked back to the edge of the
Long Clearing, where the six warriors eagerly
awaited the signal for the sport to begin. Despite
the usual stoicism and indifference of their race,
the braves were as frolicsome as so many school-boys.
They elbowed and crowded each other for
their places, and one or two vigorous wrestling
bouts occurred, before the chieftain placed them
in line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>At last the six Wyandots were drawn up in
position, one foot thrown forward, while they
swayed restlessly back and forth, inching along
the advanced foot, like so many runners eager for
the slightest advantage. Each carried his knife
and tomahawk at his girdle, but the arms were
free. He who claimed the bow of Deerfoot had
thrown it aside, now that he was about to run.</p>

<p>Waughtauk looked at his men and then he
placed himself in alignment at their right. He still
held his loaded gun, probably as an emblem of his
authority, and as a notification that he would use
it in the event of any warrior disregarding orders.</p>

<p>The seven now looked out upon the Long
Clearing at the fugitive who was to go through
this mockery of a race with the sinewy-limbed
Wyandots, eager and thirsting for his life.</p>

<p>The pose of Deerfoot was much the same as
that of his enemies. His left foot was in advance
of the other, while his weight gently oscillated
back and forth, like the swinging of a long pendulum.
Unnoticed by any of the Wyandots, he
had edged fully ten feet beyond the proper starting-point.
His face was turned as if looking at
the autumnal woods on his right, but as his handsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
profile was thrown against the sky beyond,
his eyes were scrutinizing every action of his foes,
as they arranged themselves and awaited the
signal.</p>

<p>At this juncture it must have occurred to more
than one that the Shawanoe was balancing himself
with remarkable ease for one whose sufferings
from a sprained ankle were so acute. If such a
thought came to the Wyandots, they did not lose
sight of the fact that the time for an investigation
was past.</p>

<p>For a single minute complete quiet prevailed.
The river on the left flowing calmly northward,
the solemn autumn woods on the right, the stretch
of the Long Clearing, with its irregular contour,&mdash;the
single solitary youth poised as if he were a
Grecian athlete,&mdash;the seven swarthy Indians,
like so many fierce hounds, impatient for the
moment when they might spring at the lamb
and bury their fangs in its throat:&mdash;these made
a picture striking beyond imagination in its details.</p>

<p>"<i>Whoop! whoop! whoop!</i>"</p>

<p>In quick succession the war-cry of the Wyandots
rang out on the still air, and like an electric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
shock it thrilled through every being who heard
the startling signal.</p>

<p>The ringing shout had scarcely left the lips of
Waughtauk, when Deerfoot made a tremendous
leap of nearly a dozen feet, and the instant he
lightly struck the ground he bounded away with
a burst of speed which astounded the spectators.
There was no lameness now&mdash;there had never been
the slightest. The young Shawanoe when he saw
his capture was inevitable, resorted to this strategy
with the quickness of inspiration. The
sprained ankle was a fiction&mdash;a fiction not essayed
with any thought that he would be subjected to
such a special test, but with the belief that a
chance might come in which he could make a
break for freedom and for life.</p>

<p>A series of fierce shouts went up from the
thunderstruck Wyandots, as they saw the fugitive
ricocheting over the grounds, as may be said, like
the ball from the throat of a Columbiad.</p>

<p>The halt and the lame who were the first to
step into the pool of Siloam, after the angel had
stirred the waters, were no more quickly healed
than was Deerfoot by the ringing war-cry of the
Wyandot chieftain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>A consuming anger like that of the wolf, when
the panther robs him of his prey, must have fired
the hearts of the Wyandots, at the moment they
saw the trick played on them by this despised
youth. He, a boy in stature and years, had pitted
his skill, his strategy, his woodcraft, his brains
against theirs, and he had won.</p>

<p>The readiness of Deerfoot added several rods to
the advance originally given, so that a great advantage
was thus obtained, and it was improved
to the utmost.</p>

<p>The wonderful youth ran as never before. His
lithe legs doubled under him with inconceivable
quickness, the eye seeing naught but the twinkling
of the beaded moccasins. The still wind cut by
his face as though it was a gale. He was a
gladiator stripped for the struggle, and every nerve
and muscle was strained to the last tension. He
seemed a swallow skimming close to the ground,
or a shaft driven from his own bow, so graceful
was his arrowy swiftness.</p>

<p>There were swift runners among the Wyandots,
and the seven warriors included their fleetest, who
now put forth every exertion of which they were
capable. The difference in their speed was shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
by their immediate separation, with rapidly increasing
spaces between them; but the young
Shawanoe drew away from them, as a child draws
away from the stationary object which frightens it.</p>

<p>Deerfoot saw the half mile sweeping under his
feet, as the steel rails glide under the plunging
engine, and the single glance he threw over his
shoulder told the glad fact that he had not misjudged
his own matchless ability as a runner.
Muscle and nerve and sinew never did their work
more splendidly than now, when their existence
was staked on the manner in which that work was
to be done. Human ingenuity could never construct
a piece of mechanism which could do such marvelous
service, as did those limbs of the flying fugitive
on that crisp autumn day nearly a century ago, in
Kentucky.</p>

<p>Although, as we have stated, there were many
rapid runners among the Wyandots, there was not
one who could attain and hold the terrific pace of
the Shawanoe, whose victory, it may be said, was
assured from the beginning. Fired by their fury
and chagrin, they made prodigious exertions to
run down the youth, or at least to approach close
enough to hurl their tomahawks; but this was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
useless, and with an exasperation beyond expression
they saw their victim slipping irrecoverably
from their grasp.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out on the frosty air.
Waughtauk, the chieftain, and the only one who
had a rifle, came to a dead halt and fired point
blank at the vanishing youth, hoping at least to
disable him, so he would fall into their hands.
Deerfoot heard the firing of the bullet, as it nipped
his cheek, but he did not hasten his pace,
because he was unable to do so, and no need
existed. From the first he had done his best,
and there was no room for an increase in the way
of speed.</p>

<p>A third of a mile is soon traversed at such a rate
of travel, and in a brief while Deerfoot approached
the end of the Long Clearing. His swiftness was
unabated, but, when he once more glanced around
and saw that the whole seven Indians had given
up the pursuit and were standing at varying distances
from each other looking at him, he instantly
slackened his pace.</p>

<p>Coming to a dead halt he faced about and,
swinging his arms over his head, gave utterance
to whoops and taunting exclamations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>"Have the Wyandots learned to run? Who
is Waughtauk, that a youth of the Shawanoes
should teach him to walk? Let the Wyandots
go back to their lodges and tell their squaws that
Deerfoot has taught them knowledge! Are the
Wyandots tired that they must sit down and
rest? Shall Deerfoot come back to them and
show them what to do, when their enemies are
around them?"</p>

<p>No more stinging taunts than these can be
imagined, and the Wyandots felt their full force.
They were silent, possibly because their tongue
contained no words which could give suitable expression
to their feelings.</p>

<p>Clearly it was idle to maintain the pursuit any
longer, and the seven Wyandots, including Waughtauk
the chieftain, stalked back toward the block-house,
for the purpose of pressing the siege with
more vigor than ever.</p>

<p>Up to this point they had in reality accomplished
nothing toward the reduction of the place.
They had lost several of their warriors, and Deerfoot,
as they all agreed, would make all haste to
Wild Oaks to procure help for the beleaguered
garrison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>An individual capable of such speed as he,
would reach the Ohio before nightfall; and, under
the stress of necessity, the settlers would be at
Fort Bridgman before the sun could cross the
meridian on the morrow.</p>

<p>Such was the reasoning of Waughtauk, and all
of his counsellors agreed with him. A brief while
before they would not have believed it possible
that help could be brought before the following
night; but since the occurrence just described they
were prepared to believe Deerfoot capable of doing
almost anything.</p>

<p>The precise conversation between the maddened
red men, of course, can never be known to the
historian, and it is not desirable that it should be;
but the parties concerned were so interested in the
words that they were close to the stockade of the
block-house before it was recalled that the long
valuable bow taken from Deerfoot was left lying
on the ground where the new owner threw it when
ready to join in the chase.</p>

<p>This was too valuable a trophy to be lost, and
the Wyandot immediately turned about and
hastened toward the Long Clearing to recover it,
while the others passed on to mingle with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
who were striving so hard to encompass the destruction
of the little party in the garrison.</p>

<p>The Indian who hurried back, it will be remembered,
was the one that had struck Deerfoot when
he was a captive. He had been the most cruel in
his taunts, and his hatred of the youth seemed
more malignant, if possible, than that of the
others.</p>

<p>He ground his teeth together, as he dropped
into a walk, and recalled the inimitable cleverness
with which the young warrior outwitted
them.</p>

<p>"Why did we not know the dog spoke with
two tongues? Why did we not make sure he
could not run? Why did not some of our warriors
lie in the woods at the end of the Long
Clearing to catch him, if he should escape us?"</p>

<p>"He is a dog&mdash;he is a traitor!" muttered the
fierce Wyandot, approaching the spot where he
had thrown the bow, "and he shall yet fall by my
hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about to stoop forward to pick up the
weapon, when a slight exclamation caught his ear,
and he straightened up like a flash.</p>

<p>Less than twenty feet distant stood Deerfoot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
the Shawanoe, quietly looking at him. Both had
reached the spot on the same errand, and thus
they met.</p>

<p>The youth had the advantage of detecting the
other first, and, as a consequence, was prepared.
In the language of the west, it would have been
said, under similar circumstances, that Deerfoot
"had the drop" on the other Indian.</p>

<p>The latter, as he looked up, saw that the hand
of the youth grasped his tomahawk, which was
held so far back of his hip that only a glimpse of
its edge could be seen. The arm extended straight
down so that it needed to be thrown upward and
backward, before the formidable missile could be
launched.</p>

<p>Fate seemed to favor Deerfoot that day; for
not only had he escaped from a cruel death, but
the being whom he hated above all others, and
with an intensity which only a barbarian can feel,
now stood before him.</p>

<p>There was no misunderstanding the situation
on the part of either. The Wyandot would have
resorted to any treachery to slay Deerfoot, and he
was aware that Deerfoot knew it. He had inflicted
indignities upon the young Shawanoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
which nothing less than the grace of heaven
will enable the North American Indian to forgive.</p>

<p>The two gazed fixedly at each other without
speaking, and for a second or two neither stirred a
muscle. Then, while the Wyandot centered his
burning gaze upon the bronzed face before him,
his right hand began slowly stealing up from his
hip to his girdle. It was seeking the handle of
his tomahawk, but, guarded as was the movement,
the Shawanoe saw it.</p>

<p>So absolute was Deerfoot's faith in his own
prowess and unequalled celerity that, knowing as
he did the meaning of his enemy's action, he permitted
the hand to touch the weapon, before he
affected to notice it.</p>

<p>The instant the Wyandot griped the tough
wooden handle, he snatched it forth with surprising
quickness and threw his hand back over his
head with the purpose of hurling it at the defiant
youth.</p>

<p>But the latter was the quicker. His left hand
made one lightning-like sweep, and the tomahawk
shot from his grasp with the suddenness of the
thunderbolt. Although the Wyandot threw his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
almost at the same instant, yet there was just
enough difference in time to make one a success
and the other a failure.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's weapon sped as direct as a rifle-ball,
and clove the skull of the Wyandot as though it
were card-paper. The tomahawk of the latter,
which was in the act of leaving his hand, was so
disarranged by the shock that it was thrown up in
the air and fell at his feet, as he toppled over
backwards, with a shriek which reached Waughtauk
and his warriors, and whose meaning they
knew too well.</p>

<p>Deerfoot advanced and recovered his tomahawk,
that had done this terrible execution. Then
he picked up his valued bow from the ground and
examined it to make sure that it had suffered no
injury.</p>

<p>He did not stoop to take the scalp of the dead
warrior, who hoped so ardently a brief while
before to capture his. The Shawanoe had never
scalped a vanquished foe; but when he caught
sight of several Wyandots hastening to the spot,
he flourished his bow defiantly in the air, gave utterance
to several taunting cries, and, turning his
back upon them, plunged into the wilderness with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
such speed, as to render all thought of pursuit out
of the question.</p>

<p>And as he sped like a hound on a trail, the
face of Deerfoot the Shawanoe was turned toward
the settlement of Wild Oaks on the far-away
Ohio.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="s08">THE FIERY ENEMY.</span></h2>

<p>Every one in the block-house, with the exception
of the two little girls of Colonel Preston,
was wide awake. The conviction was so strong
that the crisis was at hand, that even Blossom
Brown hunted out his young master Ned Preston,
and placing himself by his side, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I's awoke, suah's yo' bo'n."</p>

<p>"It is best that you keep awake too," replied
Ned, "for it is a good deal better than to be
awakened by fire and Indians."</p>

<p>"I can't understood why de Injines don't fight
fair," said Blossom, with a tone of impatience;
"we don't use fire on dem, and why can't dey do
de same wid us? If I could talk de Injine language,
I'd go down dar and try to argy de matter
wid 'em; I'd show 'em de&mdash;de&mdash;onscrupulousness
ob usin' de flames to burn us out. If we could
only make 'em 'shamed, dat would be a big p'int
gained."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>"It is nonsense to think of anything like that,
Blossom; the Wyandots are determined to burn
down the block-house if there is any way to do
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He abruptly stopped, for the tramp of feet was
heard outside, close to the front door. Megill and
Stinger instantly fired down in the darkness,
guided only by the sense of sound; but the cry
that rang out on the snowy air, proved that execution
was done.</p>

<p>Instantly there followed such a prodigious
shock, from a blow against the door, that the
whole building shook. Before the men could
bring their guns to bear, the sound of rapidly
running feet showed that the Indians had dropped
their battering ram and hurried off in the darkness.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment Mrs. Preston, who
was peering through the loopholes on the eastern
side, saw an Indian arrow, wrapped with blazing
tow, shoot upward from the edge of the woods,
and going slower and slower, as it curved over,
sweep downward with a whizzing rush, and strike
the roof overhead, with the same abrupt thud that
had been heard several times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>It was followed immediately by a second from
the same point, which seemed to take the same
course, for it lodged very close beside it, and also
held its place.</p>

<p>Then another flaming missile rose from the
northern side, then from the south, and then from
behind the river bank, with still others mounting
from intervening points, until a beautiful and
terrifying scene presented itself.</p>

<p>The blazing shafts followed each other in such
rapid succession, that there were fully twenty
ascending and descending at the same moment.
These made all manner of fiery parabolas in the
snowy atmosphere. One archer, who sent his missiles
from the upper window of the cabin near the
block-house, and another, who discharged his from
behind the pickets close at hand, pointed them so
nearly perpendicularly that they seemed to shoot
downward almost directly through the fiery trail
they made in their ascent. Others came from
such distant points that their parabolas were
lengthy, and they only rose a short distance above
the block-house itself, before they plunged into
the slabs of the roof.</p>

<p>These struck the latter at every possible angle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
and with every imaginable result. In some cases
the arrow was so warped in its flight that it took
a path almost as erratic as that of the Australian
boomerang. Impinging against the roof at an
acute angle, it would glance far upward, and,
turning over and over, come tumbling to the earth,
where it flickered a minute and died out.</p>

<p>Others hit the planks, and, like a mountaineer
among the rocks, who could not retain his hold,
slid down the steep incline to the ground. Still
others missed the building altogether, and, plunging
their flinty heads in the earth, were quickly
extinguished.</p>

<p>But the alarming fact remained that the majority
of the flaming missiles found a lodgment in
the roof, where they burned with a fierceness
which showed they were an improvement on those
first sent. One could not but wonder where the
Wyandots obtained all these weapons: they must
have started on the expedition with the expectation
of using this peculiar mode of warfare.</p>

<p>The fiery shower lasted but a few minutes, but
at the end of that time there were fully thirty
shafts sticking in the roof and burning vigorously.
Viewed from the outside the block-house looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
like some vast monster whose hide was pierced
with flaming spears, but who slumbered on in the
darkness, unmindful of the pests.</p>

<p>This lavish distribution of fire showed that the
ground was covered with a fine sprinkling of snow,
which was still floating downward at an almost
imperceptible rate. There was no such mantle on
the roof. It was so smooth and steep that most
of the particles ran downward and off. A thin
tiny line of snow-points was continually pouring
over the eaves, where the wind blew it to atoms
again.</p>

<p>The twists of flame made the air about the
cabin luminous, and the millions of snow-flakes
twinkled and glistened with starlike brilliancy, as
they came out of the darkness and fluttered in the
glow for a moment, ere they vanished again.</p>

<p>Several of the burning arrows were fired against
the sides of the block-house, where they flickered
a brief while. These, added to the other missiles
on the ground, threw a dull reflection through the
loopholes, that enabled the garrison to see each
other "as through a glass darkly."</p>

<p>Their figures were easily distinguishable, as
they moved carefully about, and now and then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
glimpse of a face was so ghastly and unnatural
that it was hard to recognize it. Blossom Brown
was the only one who was distinguishable at the
first glance, and even he scarcely looked like himself.</p>

<p>One unusually strong reflection from an arrow
that imbedded itself in a corner disclosed the faces
of the little sisters Mary and Susie, sleeping
beside each other, with the warm comfortable
blankets drawn close about them.</p>

<p>Each had thrown her arm over the other, and
their dimpled cheeks almost touched, as they
slumbered sweetly and peacefully, secure in that
trust in their heavenly Father, whom they had
asked to take care of them and their friends,
while the wicked Indians tried so hard to hurt
them.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the illumination, six or
eight of the Wyandots fired at the loopholes thus
made visible; but the garrison knew the danger
and kept out of range.</p>

<p>The most alarming fact about the attack was
the numerous burning arrows on the roof. Colonel
Preston and Jo Stinger agreed that, after all, this
was the most vulnerable point of the block-house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
and it was more than likely to ignite, if only a
moderate number of the fiery shafts could be
made to hold their place a short time.</p>

<p>Although some of the snow found a lodgment
under the overlapping slabs, there was not enough
to affect the bits of flame that were burning in
many places.</p>

<p>"This is bad business!" exclaimed the Colonel,
"and must be checked at once."</p>

<p>As he had done in the previous instances the
commandant drew a stool under the trap-door on
one side of the roof, while Jo Stinger did the same
on the other. When these were lifted a few
inches, the sight which greeted them was enough
to cause consternation. The light which entered
the upper story through the opening thus made
disclosed every object with great distinctness.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger saw that most of the coils of flame
were not of a dangerous nature and would soon
expire of themselves; but there were two or three
that were gaining a headway that was likely to do
alarming injury, unless checked.</p>

<p>"Be keerful, Colonel," said Jo, "the varmints
are watching us, and you'll get a shot afore you
know it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>The warning was none too soon. Several of the
Wyandots were waiting a movement of the trap-door.
They had stationed themselves in the upper
story of the cabin, which gave them the necessary
elevation, while the flaming missiles themselves
afforded all the view required.</p>

<p>Two shots were fired at the slight gap made by
the lifting of the covering, and the Colonel dropped
it with a bang and an exclamation. But he
quickly rallied and called into play some of the
strategy he had learned during a long experience
on the border.</p>

<p>The really dangerous shots (that is, those from
the upper story of the cabin) must necessarily
come from one side of the structure. The Colonel
held a piece of planking so that it would act as a
shield, and catch any of the bullets from that
point. Grasping the stock of his rifle with one
hand, he then stealthily reached out, and with
much difficulty and labor managed to dislodge the
most threatening brands in that direction.</p>

<p>This left only one in his "jurisdiction" which
he really feared. With a skill that Jo Stinger
could not restrain himself from praising, Colonel
Preston managed to send this arrow with its fiery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
mane sliding down the roof, without receiving any
harm, though more than one shot was fired at
him.</p>

<p>Much the same task confronted Jo Stinger, and
he performed it with the expertness that was to be
expected of such a veteran; but when he had
done all he could, there remained the most dangerous
shaft of all. It had lodged in the very
peak of the roof, near the southern end, which
was the closest to the cabin that sheltered the
Wyandots, and in direct range of their fire.</p>

<p>This was burning with a persistency which
looked as if the tow had been soaked with some
chemical, although such could not be the fact;
but, having found a lodgment, there it stuck and
grew, with every prospect of kindling a blaze
that would soon spread to the entire roof and
building.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger fortified himself as best he could,
and took every precaution. Then, amid the dropping
shots of the Wyandots, he carefully felt his
way forward with his rifle, until he could not extend
it an inch further: he still lacked more
than a foot of reaching the dangerous spot.</p>

<p>The red men, who saw the failure, raised a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
shout, and the scout was compelled to draw back
his weapon and muffled arm, without accomplishing
anything toward the extinguishment of
the blaze that threatened the destruction of the
block-house and all within.</p>

<p>"You think 'cause Jo Stinger has played the
fool, there's nothing left of his wit, but you'll
soon larn he hasn't forgot everything he once
knowed."</p>

<p>"Is it the only one that endangers the roof?"
asked Colonel Preston, as Jo joined them.</p>

<p>"Yes; if we can get that out, the trouble is
over for the present, though I don't know how
long it will stay so."</p>

<p>"Suppose you cannot extinguish it?" asked
Mrs. Preston.</p>

<p>"Then the block-house has got to burn."</p>

<p>This announcement caused dismay, for all felt
that the few blunt words of the scout were the
simple truth. They so affected Blossom Brown
that he dropped back on a stool, and set up a
howling that must have reached the ears of the
Wyandots outside.</p>

<p>"It's all de fault ob dat Deerhead&mdash;I mean
Deerfoot, dat was so orful anxious to run us into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
dis old place, when I told 'em it wasn't wise. I
wanted to go back to Wild Oaks where I had
some chores to do, but he obsisted, but took
mighty good care to keep out de block-house hisself,
as I took notice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Blossom Brown would have gone on for an indefinite
time with his loud wailing, had not Stinger
checked him by the threat to throw him out the
trap-door upon the roof.</p>

<p>Afraid that his bluff answer to Mrs. Preston's
question might have caused too much alarm, the
scout added&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the varmints don't do any more than <i>that</i>,
we're all right, for I'm going to put the blaze
out."</p>

<p>"You know the risk," said Colonel Preston,
apprehensive that Jo intended some effort that
would expose him to extra peril.</p>

<p>"I reckon I do," was the response of the scout,
who was the coolest one of the whole company.</p>

<p>The situation could not have been more trying
to the bravest persons. In a manner almost unaccountable,
a blaze had fastened itself in a point
of the roof beyond the reach of those within.
There it was burning and growing steadily, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the certainty that, unless checked pretty soon, it
would be beyond control.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was the only member of the garrison
who appeared equal to the task, and more than
one feared that to save the block-house he must
assume a risk that was certain to prove fatal.</p>

<p>Ned Preston caught the arm of the man in the
darkness and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can't you put it out with a wet blanket?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're a boy that <i>does</i> know something!"
exclaimed Jo, adding with a burst of
admiration, "Give me your hand, younker; that's
the very idee I had in mind."</p>

<p>This "idee," as the hunter termed it, was the
ordinary one of spreading a blanket, soaked with
water, over the spaces endangered by fire. Probably
nothing more effective could have been devised,
but it should have been adopted when the
peril involved was much less. One-half of the
entire roof was illuminated by the crackling blaze
which was steadily eating its way into the solid
timber.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, having determined on his course,
spent no time in useless conversation. Under his
direction one of the blankets was saturated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
water from the precious supply in the barrel. As
it was necessary to see what they were doing, a
tallow dip was lit and placed where it threw a
faint illumination through the interior. The garrison
could distinguish each other's figures, and no
one needed any advice to keep out of the path
of such bullets as might enter through the loopholes.</p>

<p>The scene was picturesque and striking. Mary
and Susie still lay wrapped in slumber, and their
closed eyes and innocent faces subdued every step
and word, lest they should be awakened. Father
and mother glanced fondly at them many times,
and wondered how long that refreshing unconsciousness
would continue.</p>

<p>By general agreement the entire party centered
their attention on Jo Stinger, who, having soaked
the blanket, made ready to throw it over the
stubborn fire. The task of necessity was attended
by such extreme peril that all held their peace,
oppressed by the gravity of the danger. At the
same time the crackling of the flames and the
unmistakable presence of smoke in the room
showed that, if the extinguishment was delayed
much longer, the attempt would be too late.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>Jo placed the chair directly under the trap-door
on the eastern side of the block-house and was
about to set foot on it, when Colonel Preston
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Jo, you've forgotten; the blaze is further over
on the other side."</p>

<p>"That's the reason I'm going to take <i>this</i>
side."</p>

<p>The Colonel stepped back, and the scout laid
the dripping blanket upon one arm, as though it
were an overcoat. Grasping the edge of the
opening, and helped by Megill from below, he
quickly climbed upward, opening the door at the
proper moment by the pressure of his head
against it.</p>

<p>It was not raised an inch more than necessary,
when he slowly crept out, like a crab casting its
shell.</p>

<p>The blaze which was the cause of all this alarm
and care was started, as will be remembered, in
the very peak of the roof, but from some cause it
had worked its way down the western side, which
was necessarily illuminated through its entirety
by the light therefrom.</p>

<p>The shifting of the fire threw the eastern half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
of the roof in comparative shadow, though the
flickering glow was quite certain to reveal the
figure of any large object on it. The fact that Jo
emerged with his dripping blanket without drawing
a shot, led him to hope that his action was
unsuspected.</p>

<p>In order to "play every point," Colonel Preston
cautiously raised the trap-door on the other side a
few inches, and, guarding his face and arm, extended
the stock of his rifle toward the blaze, as
if he expected to pound it out.</p>

<p>He advanced the weapon quite slowly and with
a movement intended to impress the sharpshooters
with the belief that he had perfected an arrangement
by which he was able to reach the endangered
point.</p>

<p>As he anticipated, this diversion drew several
shots, which whistled about his head with a vigor
that gave him a vivid idea of the vigilance of the
besieging Wyandots.</p>

<p>While this counter-movement was in progress,
Jo Stinger was carefully making his way along
the roof on the other side. The unusual steepness
made this difficult, and had he not grasped
the peak and held on, he would have shot along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the slope to the ground, as if sliding down the
side of a tree.</p>

<p>Inch by inch he progressed, expecting every
minute that a bullet would be fired at him. He
kept the saturated blanket well rolled together
and in front, so that it served the purpose of a
shield against any shot from the cabin, where the
sharpshooters seemed to have gathered for the
purpose of keeping the roof clear of all persons.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger had nearly reached the point from
which he expected to "ring down the curtain" on
the flame, when he was confronted by an experience
altogether novel and unexpected.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the burning arrows had done such
good service, one of the Wyandots on the edge of
the woods launched another, which went high in
the air and, curving gracefully over, plunged
downward toward the roof.</p>

<p>Jo had no knowledge of its approach, until he
heard the whizzing rush of the flaming shaft, as
it drove its head against the wet blanket, glanced
off and slid to the earth.</p>

<p>"It won't do to loaf 'round here," he muttered,
"or I'll be crawling over the roof with a dozen
blazing arrers, and if Jo Stinger knows hisself, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
don't mean to play walkin' lantern for the Wyandot
varmints."</p>

<p>He had attained the position he was seeking,
and a most delicate piece of work was before him,
but he was equal to it.</p>

<p>The Indians, who were gathered in the cabin,
and collected at different points in the woods and
along the stockade, watching the flame with no
little exultation, saw it creeping downward and
spreading with a rapidity which boded ill for the
garrison huddled beneath.</p>

<p>The fine, silver-like snowflakes glistened in the
fire-light, and floated shudderingly down the
roof, without affecting the blaze; but at the
moment when scores of eyes were gleaming like
those of so many wild beasts, a dark shadow suddenly
disclosed itself&mdash;what seemed an immense
black hand spread out and closed over the dangerous
fire, which was instantly extinguished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="s08">THE TUG OF WAR.</span></h2>

<p>The extinguishment of the burning roof, for
the time, was complete. Utter darkness came
like the blowing out of a candle in a vault.</p>

<p>"The varmints know what it means!" muttered
Jo Stinger, who made a hurried retreat along the
roof toward the trap-door, which had been thrown
wide open in readiness for his reception.</p>

<p>The Wyandots were quick to learn the cause of
the sudden darkness, and they opened a brisk fire
on the roof. This necessarily was at random, and
the scout dropped through to the floor, without
so much as a scratch upon him.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston and his friends would have felt
like uttering a cheer over the success of Jo's
boldness, but for the conviction that the worst was
yet to come and was close at hand.</p>

<p>One fact was so apparent that it caused a
strengthening of hope: the wind, which had been
blowing almost a gale from the south, had fallen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
so that the lull was perceptible. Should the Wyandots
fire the cabin standing a short distance
from the block-house, the flames were not likely
to communicate unless the gale appeared again.</p>

<p>All was darkness once more. The wind soughed
dismally through the trees and moaned around the
block-house, which was scorched and still smoking
from the burning arrows of the Wyandots. The
fine snowflakes were still sifting downward, and
far overhead was heard again the honk of wild
geese flying to the milder regions of the south.</p>

<p>From within the settler's cabin standing near
the stockade came a dull glow, but there was no
other sign of life that eye could detect. And yet
the block-house was environed by hostile red men,
who were as eager as so many wolves to break into
the fold.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston, Jo Stinger, Megill, Turner,
and the boys were at the loopholes watching and
listening. Mrs. Preston alternated from the side
of her children to that of her husband, exchanging
words with the brave man who had been so
cramped in his movements for the last day or two
that he was unable to do the service he wished to
render his friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>The sounds of hurrying feet, the hoarse guttural
exclamations and the bird-like signals showed that
the Wyandots were near the fort. They had taken
advantage of the Egyptian darkness to steal up
close to the sides of the building, where their
presence could only be discovered through some
movement that made a noise sufficient to reach the
ears of the listeners above.</p>

<p>Several times the heavy log which they had
dragged from the river bank was carried stealthily
up to within a few feet of the building, when,
having located the door, they ran forward with
the battering ram. Delivering the blow they
dropped the log and scampered to escape the
shots which were sent after them in the darkness.</p>

<p>Now and then some of these bullets found their
mark, and the assailants learned to their cost that
it was not simple amusement on which they were
engaged.</p>

<p>Believing they had made some impression on
the door, eight Wyandots stole forward, lifted the
tree-trunk from the ground, and stepped heavily
and quietly backward several paces, where they
paused to gather breath for the fierce rush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>At the very moment they had concentrated
their strength and were in the act of moving, a
flaming arrow sped upward like a rocket from the
other side the clearing, and, curving over, went a
short distance beyond the block-house, and, by a
singular mischance, buried its head in the log,
which was held above the ground and in the act
of being plunged against the door.</p>

<p>The shaft stuck and the flaming twist of tow
gave partial glimpses of the eight swarthy figures
laboring toward the building with the timber between
the two divisions. The knowledge that
they were exposed to the aim of the Kentuckians,
spread consternation among the Wyandots, who
released the burden so suddenly that it fell upon
one warrior's foot.</p>

<p>The pain was so acute that, like a civilized being,
he caught the injured member in both hands
and danced round and round on the other foot,
howling with torture, while the others skurried
away in the darkness, as though a bomb-shell had
burst among them.</p>

<p>The crack of several well-aimed rifles hastened
the steps of these frightened warriors, and he who
was nursing his bruised foot dropped it and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
limped off, with a haste that would have been
impossible under other circumstances.</p>

<p>This incident, which was not without its element
of comedy, was followed by a still more
singular one.</p>

<p>Despite the vigilance of the garrison, the Wyandots
were constantly tempted to efforts which,
it would seem, promised no success at all, and
which exposed them to great danger from the
rifles of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>We have described the windows on the lower
story of the block-house, which were without
panes, long and so narrow that it was not deemed
possible that any person could force his body
through.</p>

<p>And yet there was one warrior who had probably
spent most of the day in considering the
matter, and who concluded there was a chance for
him to succeed, where all others had failed.</p>

<p>A peculiar noise on the lower floor led Colonel
Preston to descend the ladder to investigate. For
some minutes he was unable to conjecture what the
disturbance could mean, but the faint glow thrown
out by the flaming arrow which drove its head
into the log, showed that the window at the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
of the front door was blocked up by an Indian,
who was wedged fast, and unable to get in or out.</p>

<p>He was struggling desperately, but could not
extricate himself, and the astounded commandant
concluded that, if he was attenuated enough to
enter that far, he was probably capable of going
still further, and must be a curiosity in the way
of bulk which was worth seeing.</p>

<p>The Colonel shuddered to think what would
have been the result if this savage had secured an
entrance. It would have taken him but a minute
or two to remove the fastenings of the door, when
the whole horde of ferocious red men would have
swarmed in.</p>

<p>The officer immediately ran forward and, catching
the two arms of the intruder, pinioned them.
Then he began pulling with might and main. That
he might not throw away any strength, he placed
both feet against the logs below the window, and,
leaning back, threw all his energy in the effort.</p>

<p>So great was the force exerted that in all likelihood
he would have succeeded in drawing the exceedingly
thin warrior through the window, had
not a couple of friends, at the same moment,
seized his legs, which were frantically beating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
vacancy, and commenced pulling with equal ardor
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The Wyandot was now as anxious to retreat as
he had been to advance, and he strove to help his
friends; but his efforts were so handicapped that
he gave them little if any assistance.</p>

<p>The arrow which had burned so brightly for a
minute or two expired, so that all was darkness
once more, and the singular tug of war
went on.</p>

<p>When Colonel Preston held his breath, compressed
his lips and did his utmost, he felt the
Indian move forward several inches in response;
but there were a couple fully as muscular, and inspired
by as strong enthusiasm as the pioneer. The
tug which they put forth brought the brave back
again, with probably a slight gain.</p>

<p>The warriors at the heels had the additional
advantage of the sympathies of the one over
whom they were disputing, and who bid fair to
become elongated to an alarming extent by this
singular controversy. He kept twisting his hands
in such a way that he broke the hold of Colonel
Preston more than once, while he quieted his legs
so as to favor his friends all he could.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>The first flirt which the Indian made was so
sudden and unexpected that the Colonel fell
backwards on the floor; but he was up on the
instant, and grappled the sinewy arms again.</p>

<p>"If this keeps on much longer," thought the
officer, "something must give way. Suppose we
should pull the rascal in two, with half inside and
half out. That might be fair to us, but the Indian,
considered strictly as an Indian, would not
be of much account. I wonder whether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello, Colonel, what's going on?"</p>

<p>Jo Stinger had heard the singular disturbance,
and, unable to guess its meaning, was hurrying
down the ladder to inform himself.</p>

<p>The exquisite absurdity of the situation caused
a momentary reaction from the gloom which had
oppressed Colonel Preston, and led him to reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've got a red man here that we're using as a
cross-cut saw, and we've stretched him out to
almost double&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant the individual referred to,
knowing that all depended on one supreme effort,
wrenched his wrists loose and, like a flash, struck
the Colonel such a blow in the face that he reeled
backwards almost to the other side the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>The Wyandots at the other end of the line were
reinforced at the critical juncture by two others,
who caught hold of their man wherever it was the
most convenient, and the four gave a long pull, a
strong pull, and a pull altogether, that was sure to
accomplish something definite.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the elongated Indian his legs
were equal to the strain, and he shot backward
through the opening like the lady in the show,
who is fired from the giant cannon by the aid of
springs alone. He and his friends rolled over in
one promiscuous heap, but were quickly on their
feet and skurried away in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger scarcely credited the singular story
when the Colonel related it, but when the particulars
were given, he could not refuse to believe.</p>

<p>"You could have ended it, Colonel, when you
had his head inside," said the scout.</p>

<p>"I know that, but I did not like the thought
of taking such a frightful disadvantage of an
enemy."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to have done it without
thinking," muttered Jo, who was beginning to feel
less mercy toward the Wyandots, since they had
made their own furious hatred so manifest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>"If there's any likelihood of that varmint trying
the thing over again, I'd stay here; but a chap
who goes through, or tries to go through what he
did, is apt to get enough."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," assented Colonel Preston,
who was still rubbing his face where the vigorous
blow had fallen upon it.</p>

<p>There was no occasion to remain below-stairs,
and the two went up the ladder, where a consultation
was held as to what was best to do, if indeed
they could do anything in their perilous situation.</p>

<p>Midnight had passed, and a hope was gaining
ground that, if they could hold out until morning,
the prospect of beating off the Wyandots would
be improved. The American Indian seems incapable
of doing his best work except in darkness,
and another night of such utter gloom as the
present was not likely to come.</p>

<p>It was not known, of course, that Deerfoot had
escaped from his enemies, and the belief was
general that his career had been brought to an
untimely end; but, as we have shown, the young
Shawanoe, with all his fleetness, could not bring
reinforcements from Wild Oaks before the succeeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
night, and it would have been a great
feat could he accomplish it in that limited
time.</p>

<p>The garrison had enough food to last them a
week, and the supply of water was sufficient for
the same time, unless too many draughts should
be required by the work of the torch and burning
arrows.</p>

<p>A continuous assault upon the door and the
frequent firing into the loopholes and windows
promised something, but the danger and delay
which attended such work were too great for the
red men, who knew the value of time as well as
did the settlers themselves.</p>

<p>All within noted the direction and strength of
the wind with an anxiety which cannot be described.
The space separating the block-house
and the cabin was so small that a slight gale from
the right quarter was certain to carry the flames
from one to the other. Both parties therefore
were watching the indications with an equal intensity
of interest.</p>

<p>Once the wind was just right, but a lull came,
as the torch was about to be applied, and Waughtauk,
after recovering from the terror caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
the appearance of the scout at the window, must
have felt a grim impatience, as he saw the hours
steadily slipping away, with no marked change in
the situation.</p>

<p>But the fiery arrows had done excellently well,
although at the critical moment a wet blanket, in
the full sense of the word, was thrown upon the
prospects of the assailants. Waughtauk and his
sharpshooters knew how cleverly they had been
outwitted, and they were sure the strategy could
not succeed a second time.</p>

<p>The orders were therefore given to try the blazing
missiles again, and in a few minutes a converging
fire was opened, which looked as if a
miniature bombardment had begun.</p>

<p>The pyrotechnic display, under the peculiar
circumstances, was singularly striking.</p>

<p>By and by the missiles found a lodgment on the
roof of the block-house, and the twists of flame
once more lit up the rough surface, scorched and
blackened in many places, and on which the flakes,
instead of sliding off, as aforetime, seemed to stick
with an unusual persistency.</p>

<p>There were broad patches of snow over the
greater portion, and although some of the arrows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
held, yet the major number fell over, after striking
and flickering a few minutes, and went out. The
flakes which had collected now helped blot out the
flames.</p>

<p>The cause of these changed conditions was due
to a number of saturated blankets that had been
carefully spread over the roof. During the darkness
which followed Jo Stinger's exploit, and after
Colonel Preston's failure to win in his tug of war
with the Wyandot, the garrison had wisely improved
the time by soaking quilts with water and
laying them over the most ignitable portion of the
roof.</p>

<p>Men and boys had given up those appropriated
to their use; indeed all had been taken, except
those which protected the little girls while sleeping.
The mother offered those, if needed, willing
to enfold and warm her little ones with her own
loving arms, and such few extra garments as could
be gathered among the company; but the scout
declined, saying he had all he could use. At the
same time he would have given anything in his
possession for enough material to plaster the entire
surface.</p>

<p>Favored by the sheltering darkness, Jo then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
stretched these coverings over the slabs. He
fastened them together and balanced them over
the ridge, so there was no possibility of their slipping
off.</p>

<p>This was done with such care that no space was
lost. The temperature was so low that in a few
minutes the blankets were stiff with frost, and,
although the hunter was toughened by many
years' exposure, his hands became so benumbed
he could hardly use them.</p>

<p>It was these frosty blankets which caught the
snow and held it, and which rendered useless so
many of the burning shafts discharged by the
Wyandots.</p>

<p>But there were spaces where the seasoned wood
was exposed. Several of the blazing missiles, as
might have been expected, lodged there and began
burning their way into the timber.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as these flames lit up the gloom,
the Wyandots, eagerly looking upon the scene
from every point of the compass, saw a sight
which must have amazed them: it was the figure
of a man stretched out at full length on the roof,
holding on with one hand, while the other seemed
to be occupied in giving the finishing touches to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the saturated goods, which, so far as they went,
were an effective shield against the fire.</p>

<p>Was ever such reckless daring known? It
looked as if the scout Jo Stinger deliberately invited
this manner of his taking off, in preference
to torture by flame, or at the hands of his dusky
enemies.</p>

<p>If such were the fact, the Wyandots did not
restrain their fire. Every one who commanded the
position immediately opened upon the poor fellow,
and the sharpshooters in the cabin near at
hand discharged their pieces with unerring accuracy.</p>

<p>Bullet after bullet struck the figure which, as it
lay at full length, was a fair target for the many
rifles. Still he held on and made no effort to lift
the trap-door and drop beyond range of the
deadly sleet hurtling about him.</p>

<p>But there is a limit to the capacity of the
strongest, and all at once the hold was loosened.
He seemed to catch vainly at the steep roof, over
which he began slipping; but there was nothing
which he could grasp that would stay his downward
flight. Faster and faster he went, until he
shot over the eaves, and, striking the ground, collapsed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
in a limp heap in which there was not a
particle of life.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, with whoops of delight, dashed
forward from the darkness, each eager to be the
first to scalp the man whom they well knew, and
regarded as the most formidable member of the
garrison.</p>

<p>Forgetful of the risk they ran (for the spot
where the inanimate figure fell was revealed by
the burning arrows), the warriors scrambled with
each other as to who should secure the coveted
trophy.</p>

<p>Scarcely a full minute had passed when cries of
rage and chagrin were heard from the disappointed
group: for that which they seized and struck at
was not a man at all, but a dummy cunningly
put together, and placed in such a position on the
top of the block-house that not a Wyandot who
fired at it had the slightest suspicion that he was
throwing his ammunition away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="s08">THE SOUTH WIND.</span></h2>

<p>The project of placing a dummy on the roof of
the block-house, with a view of drawing the
fire of the Wyandots, was original with Jo
Stinger. It is hard to see what good was attained,
for more than enough ammunition remained to
prosecute the battle with all energy, whenever
the opportunity presented itself to the assailants.</p>

<p>The explanation of the act is found in the
mental composition of the frontiersman himself.
He had been outwitted more than once by the Indians,
and he wished to show them that he had
not lost entirely the cunning which had made his
name known among many of the tribes that
roamed and hunted through Ohio and the Dark
and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>Still further, those men who are accustomed to
scenes of danger and daring are not without a
certain element of humor in their make-up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
when one's spirits are oppressed for a long period,
the rebound, at times, is so sudden that he is impelled
to words and acts so incongruous as to excite
the wonderment of friends.</p>

<p>Jo constructed the dummy to look as much
like himself as possible. The clothing and material
for this could be ill spared, but he furnished
most of it himself, and when the image was
placed in position, he was as impatient as a child
for the sport that followed.</p>

<p>Poor distressed Mrs. Preston could see no justification
of such levity at so serious a time. Megill
and Turner enjoyed it scarcely less than their
friend, while the Colonel affected an interest which
he was far from feeling.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown laughed heartily over the discomfiture
of the red men, and Ned Preston forgot
his dread and grief for the moment; but they
quickly returned, and the depression of all was
doubtless greater from the temporary lifting of
spirits the incident caused.</p>

<p>The Wyandots had hardly discovered the deception,
when all three of the men at the loopholes
fired into them. The shots produced results too,
and the assailants became more cautious of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Kentuckians, who had learned to use their guns
with such accuracy of aim.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, in spreading the wetted blankets
over the roof, had shown not only skill and courage,
but good judgment. The protection was secured
at the remotest points, which it was impossible to
reach from either of the trap-doors, without exposing
themselves to the certain aim of the Wyandot
sharpshooters. The uncovered portions
were those within reach.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger and Colonel Preston passed to the
southern side of the building, from which they
could look out upon the nearest cabin. Here a
number of Indians were gathered, as there had
been almost from the first.</p>

<p>"Your errand, I've no doubt, Jo, is the same
as mine," said the officer, in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt of that," replied the scout,
"always providin' yours is the same as mine."</p>

<p>"I'm watching the wind."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"How do you find it?"</p>

<p>"It's blowing from the south."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," remarked the Colonel, with a
pang of misgiving, as he received a puff through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the loophole, directly in the face; "is it stronger
than before?"</p>

<p>"It's blowing harder than it did a half hour
ago, but not so hard as two hours since."</p>

<p>"The worst feature about the business is that
the wind is not only from the wrong point of the
compass, but it is increasing."</p>

<p>"You speak the solemn truth, Colonel, but it
aint sartin the varmints have got us anyway&mdash;helloa!"</p>

<p>To the consternation of every one in the block-house
the tread of feet was heard on the roof at
that moment. Some one ran nimbly along the
slabs, stooping down and holding himself from
slipping by grasping the ridge with his hands.</p>

<p>By what possible means he gained this perch,
was beyond the conjecture of any one; but the
crisis was too grave to admit of an instant's delay.
The warrior, beyond a doubt, had assumed this
perilous risk with a view of tearing off the blankets,
which shielded the roof from the flaming
arrows.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger dropped his gun, sprang upon a
stool, and leaped upward through the trap-door.
Had he vaulted upon the roof with less celerity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
he would have been dispatched by the Indian, who
would have had him almost at his mercy; but the
first warning the Wyandot received of his coming
was his arrival.</p>

<p>The scout was aroused, and no athlete could
have handled himself more deftly than did he.
The very moment he was outside he moved several
feet away from the opening and placed himself
astride of the ridge pole.</p>

<p>This was the most secure position he could hold,
and he peered around in the darkness and listened
for something that would tell him where his enemy
was. His unusually keen vision was of no use
under the circumstances. There was not the
slightest ember burning near him, nor was there
a ray of moonlight or starlight to pierce the blackness
of night.</p>

<p>But the Wyandot was there. He had removed
several of the blankets, and was working at the
others when the sound of the trap-door told him
the important truth that a second person was on
the roof.</p>

<p>The warrior could have slid down to the eaves
and dropped to the ground without injury to himself;
but that would have forced him to leave his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
work uncompleted, and he was too true a brave
to do that.</p>

<p>Nothing loth to engage in a personal encounter,
he began stealing along the ridge toward the point
where he believed the white man was awaiting
him. As Stinger held himself rigid and motionless,
his precise location could not be determined
at once; but the Indian's approach, guarded
though it was, told Jo exactly where to search for
his adversary.</p>

<p>Never was a barbarian taken more completely
at fault. He made a fatal miscalculation, and one
minute later, when he fell to the ground, he was
as lifeless as the dummy which preceded him.</p>

<p>How this savage managed to reach the roof,
puzzled Stinger beyond expression. He sat bolt
upright on the ridge, looking around in the blank
darkness, listening and thinking, and speculating
upon the all-absorbing problem.</p>

<p>"It must be they rigged up some sort of ladder
by cutting down a sapling; then they've leaned it
aginst the eaves and he has shinned up, almost
rubbing agin the muzzles of our guns,&mdash;but he
won't climb any more ladders of <i>that</i> kind I
reckon."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>There was reason to fear the attempt would be
repeated, and the scout retained his perch fully
ten minutes, that he might be prepared to nip
such a scheme in the bud.</p>

<p>Nothing to cause alarm occurred. Jo proceeded
to investigate as carefully as he could the mischief
done by the Wyandot who paid so dearly for it.</p>

<p>To his dismay the scout soon learned that the
Indian had almost completed the task he undertook.
He had torn off the frosty blankets and
sent them rolling and sliding to the ground, as
though they were so many ribbons fluttering in
the wind.</p>

<p>Great damage in this respect had been done,
and it was irreparable.</p>

<p>The scout had hitched along until close to the
trap-door, where he paused a moment listening, in
the hope of learning something of the movements
of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>Loth as he was to admit it, he could not shut
out the terrifying fact that the wind, which had
set in from the south, was still rising and must
soon reach a degree that would tempt the red men
to fire the cabin, with the almost certain prospect
of the flames communicating to the block-house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>Jo was contemplating this terrible contingency,
when he heard several signals between parties near
at hand. He had no way of knowing their meaning,
but, while he was looking and listening,
another burning arrow suddenly shot up from the
edge of the clearing, in its curvilinear flight for
the roof of the block-house.</p>

<p>"I wonder how near that is coming to <i>me</i>,"
muttered Jo, looking upward at the comet-like
missile; "it turns beautiful&mdash;now it seems to halt
like a swimmer looking for a spot where to dive&mdash;now
it turns&mdash;down she comes&mdash;she is going to
land on the roof sure&mdash;she's coming for me&mdash;<i>great
guns</i>!"</p>

<p>Up went the trap-door, and down shot the
scout like a seal who plunges into the air-hole
just in time to elude the spear of the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>The spot vacated by the hunter was struck the
fraction of a second after by the arrow, which
would have played sad havoc with him, had he
been less alert in his movements.</p>

<p>The expectation of the garrison, now that the
roof had been cleared of the blankets, was that
the Wyandots would repeat the bombardment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
burning missiles, with an absolute certainty of
success.</p>

<p>Such, there is every reason to believe, would
have been the case, but for the favoring air which
rendered any repetition of that species of warfare
unnecessary.</p>

<p>It had ceased snowing, and the wind from the
south was blowing strongly. Everything favored
the method of attack which Stinger heard the
chieftain Waughtauk declare should be used
against the settlers.</p>

<p>By common agreement and without a word, the
entire party passed to the southern side of the
building and peered through the loopholes at the
cabin, in which it was known a number of their
enemies were gathered.</p>

<p>"If they have fixed upon this plan of assault,"
said Colonel Preston to Stinger, "why do they
wait?"</p>

<p>"The varmints are good judges of weather, and
they may be sartin the wind will be stronger by
and by."</p>

<p>"But it seems strong enough to bring the
flames over to us, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>They've set fire to the cabin!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>The exclamation came from Ned Preston, who
was at the elbow of Jo Stinger. Every one who
was looking out in the darkness saw that he spoke
the appalling truth.</p>

<p>The building nearest them had a door and window
on the first floor, and two windows above, all
facing the block-house. It was in the lower story
that Waughtauk and his most trusted warriors
had been grouped for hours, after having decided
what should be the line of action toward the besieged
settlers.</p>

<p>From the window on the lower floor suddenly
issued a tongue of flame, which darted out and
back with great rapidity. Then the whole
interior became one vivid red glow, fire was
seen shooting in every direction, and volumes
of smoke began pouring from the upper windows.</p>

<p>The torch was applied, and the last, final test
of the block-house had come.</p>

<p>The garrison were awed spectators of the scene.
All understood what it meant, and there was no
call for words; but as the southern side of the
block-house, as well as the roof, were to be exposed
to a furnace-like heat, the water was gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
in vessels, where it could be used the instant
needed.</p>

<p>The Wyandots had hurried out of the building
before the flames were fairly going, so as not to
expose themselves to the rifles of the Kentuckians;
but as the flames spread and the circle of illumination
widened, the dusky foes were seen skulking
behind the other cabin, along the stockade, and in
the clearing, watching the destruction, and the
massive block-house, whose heavy logs, steep overhanging
roof, rude chimney and rugged outlines
loomed up in the crimson glow against the background
of blank darkness.</p>

<p>There was not a snowflake in the air, but the
spotless white on the ground showed in many
places where the mantle had been disturbed by
the moccasins of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>The glare seemed to reach the clouds, and the
myriads of sparks which went drifting to the
northward, and falling over an area of many
acres, brought out the gaunt, skeleton-like figures
of the trees, which seemed to look solemnly
forth from the dim woods, where the white
and red men only met in scenes of violence and
blood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>The garrison allowed themselves to be restrained
by no sentimentality, for it was an hour when
every shot counted. The glow of the ascending
flames continually flung back the sheltering mantle
of night enveloping the figures of the warriors,
who were not always quick to remember the danger
to which they were thus exposed.</p>

<p>But when four or five well-aimed rifles were
fired from the loopholes, that were lit up with an
illumination greater than that of the noonday
sun, the survivors made haste to run back into
the gloom, or to throw themselves behind some
shelter.</p>

<p>The situation of those in the block-house
became distressing beyond expression. The wind,
blowing strongly in that direction, quickly filled
the room with suffocating smoke, which, for a minute
or two, threatened to overcome every one. The
vapor, however, gave way to the heat, which was
uncomfortable, although, so long as the logs did
not take the flames, they could not cause much
suffering.</p>

<p>The smoke and its miseries awoke little Mary
and Susie Preston, whose terror, when they saw
through the loopholes the burning cabin, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
were not too young to understand their peril,
touched the hearts of all. They began crying
piteously and, trembling in every limb, threw their
arms first about the neck of mamma and then of
papa, sobbing and clinging convulsively to each in
turn.</p>

<p>"The wicked Indians will kill you: we know
they will; they will kill papa and mamma, and that
will break our hearts."</p>

<p>After a time, the mother was able to quiet
them, and then both, without any agreement,
knelt at her knee and prayed with the pathetic
faith of childhood.</p>

<p>"Our Heavenly Father, don't let the bad Indians
hurt papa nor mamma, nor Jo, nor Mr.
Turner, nor Mr. Megill, nor cousin Ned, nor
Blossom, nor us. Don't let them hurt anybody;
take care of us all; make us good girls.
Amen."</p>

<p>Who shall say that the petition from the
hearts of the innocent and trusting little ones
was not wafted upward by the wings of listening
angels, who were quick to bear the message
to Him whose ear is never closed? And who
shall say that He, leaning over the celestial battlements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
did not look down on that wild scene
in the grim forests, and stay the hand of the
vengeful Wyandot, as it was raised to smite his
pale-face brother to the earth?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="s08">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>The wind from the south was so strong that
most of the large sparks capable of carrying
the fire were thrown beyond the block-house, falling
about the stockade, on the clearing, and among
the trees, where they kindled spiral serpents of
flame and smoke, which quickly died of themselves.</p>

<p>But as the blaze grew hotter and hotter, it
seemed to converge its fierce heat upon the doomed
block-house, as the blowpipe melts the obdurate
metal. The upper room became filled with the
quivering air, and more than one wondered how it
was the logs withstood the furnace-like blast so
long.</p>

<p>Although the two cabins were closer to each
other than to the fort, yet the untouched one was
in no danger because of the direction of the wind.
The structure which had been lighted, burned
furiously, and those who were watching its progress
soon detected smoke from the block-house itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>Jo Stinger was surprised to learn that, instead
of being on the roof, it was from one of the windows
almost directly under him&mdash;almost the last
place where he expected the flames to catch.</p>

<p>While he was peering downward through the
openings at his feet, he discovered the blaze.</p>

<p>A quart or two of water, well applied, extinguished
it, and he called at the others to make
known at once any other flame they might see.
The warning was scarcely given, when Blossom
Brown shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here it am! here it am! burnin' like all
creation!"</p>

<p>The dusky lad was not mistaken, for the logs
below them had caught again, and considerable
water was required before it succumbed. However,
it went out at last, and the thick smoke and
steam climbed upward into the face of Blossom,
who coughed until he seemed nearly racked to
pieces.</p>

<p>Doubtless the Wyandots could have poured in
a volley of shots through the loopholes, which
would have slain a number of the hapless defenders;
but now, when nothing could prevent the
capture of the entire party, the red men preferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
that the company should fall into their hands
intact.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was standing at the south-east
angle of the block-house, looking toward the
burning building, when he saw something which,
for the time, made him doubt the evidence of his
own senses.</p>

<p>His position was such that he could look
directly along the western side of the cabin, which
was unharmed by the flames. This, it will be
noted, was the portion that adjoined the burning
structure. On this side of the building, which
was not burning, the heat was not very great, but
the illumination was so strong that it was as
light as midday, and no Wyandot ventured near
it, through fear of the rifles of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>The youth was watching the cabin, around and
through which the flames were raging so furiously,
when an Indian warrior walked into view. From
what point he came, the watcher could not tell:
the first he saw of him was when he approached
the logs of the other structure. He moved slowly,
as if surveying all sides, and when he turned and
reached the door, he was seen to raise his hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and pass within, where, of course, he vanished
from sight.</p>

<p>This of itself would not have been so extraordinary,
but for the fact that the handsome face,
distinctly shown in the glare, the slight, graceful
figure, carrying a long bow in his right hand, and
displaying the quiver of arrows over his shoulder,
identified the Indian as Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>Despite the frightful situation, Ned Preston
could scarcely restrain a cheer, for he was thrilled
with a pleasure beyond description over the unexpected
discovery that his devoted friend was
still alive.</p>

<p>Ned darted to the side of Jo Stinger and told
him what he had seen.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it, younker?" demanded the
scout sharply.</p>

<p>"Sure of it? It is impossible that I should be
mistaken; I know him as well as I do you, and
he stood in the full glare of the firelight."</p>

<p>"You're right; it <i>was</i> the Shawanoe; I seen
him; I thought the young varmint was dead, but
he's a good deal more alive this minute than we
are."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Jo, what does it mean? Why did he
come out there where he could be seen, and go into
the building?"</p>

<p>"He wanted us to notice him, and it was the
best thing he could do. The varmints toward the
river and in the clearin' must have cotched sight
of him; but before they could larn his name and
post-office address, he was inside."</p>

<p>"But I can't understand his cause for entering
the cabin any way; what good can he do us
there?"</p>

<p>"I've my 'spicion&mdash;<i>there</i>! that's what I expected!"</p>

<p>A crackling, snapping sound overhead told the
alarming truth: the roof was burning fiercely,
and there was no possible way of putting out
the flames. In fact, it had been ablaze some
time, for the fiery points were seen in several
places along the ridge-pole, fast eating their
way, so to speak, into the vitals of the building.</p>

<p>A minute after the sparks began falling through
upon the floor, the vapor loaded with fire filtered
through the loopholes, and the upper story had
become untenable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>"Down the ladder!" said Jo Stinger; "it
won't do to wait any longer."</p>

<p>He led the way himself, and the others followed
in rather a pell-mell fashion. All, however, safely
reached the lower story, where the situation was
improved for a brief time only.</p>

<p>Smoke and fire were around them; the air was
thick with strangling vapor and blistering sparks;
the glow illuminated the interior, as if with a
thousand lamps, and the ghastly countenances
were rendered more unearthly by the lurid light
which permeated everywhere.</p>

<p>Megill, Turner and Stinger were grim and silent.
They had faced death before, and they were certain
always to meet him with the front of heroes. The
pale face of Mrs. Preston was calm, and she was
sustained by the unfaltering trust of the Christian
who forgets not that, however great the sufferings
awaiting him, they can never equal the anguish
of Him who gave up his life on Calvary for the
world.</p>

<p>She kept her little ones close to her side. She
had held a rifle when the danger first appeared;
but she did not discharge it, and it was now cast
aside. She remained near her husband, who, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
low voice, spoke encouraging words to her and his
little ones, and who was resolved to die fighting
in defence of those who were a thousand times
dearer to him than his own life.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown was stupefied by the overwhelming
terror of the scene. He moved about
in a stolid, ox-like fashion, capable of obeying
blindly whatever those around told him to do.</p>

<p>It was apparent even to the little children, who
had hushed their cries, that it was impossible to
stay more than a few minutes longer in the block-house.
It was already on fire in a dozen different
places, and was burning furiously. The fugitives
might remain huddled together a short while, but
only to meet the most awful of deaths; or they
could venture forth and fall into the hands of the
treacherous Wyandots.</p>

<p>"The door of that cabin over there is partly
open, as you can obsarve," said Jo Stinger; "the
logs haven't been scorched by fire, as you can also
obsarve; we'll make a run for that door, and arter
we get inside, we'll fight till the death, as you'll
also obsarve."</p>

<p>"But they can shoot us down while we're on
the way," said Colonel Preston.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>"They can, but they won't; for they'd rather
make us prisoners. No red varmint shall ever
take <i>me</i> captive."</p>

<p>"Nor me either," added Turner and Megill together.</p>

<p>"That seems to be the only thing we can do.
We ought to be able to make a stand there until
to-morrow, when there may be help from Wild
Oaks."</p>

<p>"All make ready; I'll lead the way."</p>

<p>There was not a heart from which a fervent
prayer was not sent up to heaven; but the men
compressed their lips and nerved themselves for
the final effort. Colonel Preston caught up Mary
the elder, kissed and pressed her to his heart.
She returned the caresses, and he held her on his
left arm, while the right hand grasped his rifle.
The wife did the same with Susie, for the weapon
she had cast aside was too valuable to leave behind.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better lead de way?" asked Blossom
Brown, crowding forward.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I'll kind ob darken tings, so de Injines
can't see us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait till we start, and then you may lead if
you can."</p>

<p>Jo Stinger leaned his long rifle against the wall,
and with a firm, strong hand removed the bars
one after the other. Then the door was drawn
inward, he picked up his gun, and looked around
at the group.</p>

<p>"Foller me!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he strode forth, the others close
on his heels. Blossom Brown made a plunge to
pass the leader, but as he did not know which way
to turn, he fell back.</p>

<p>The scout diverged to the left, and, with the
same deliberate tread, passed over the open space
between the burning cabin and the blazing block-house.
A short time before, this would have been
impossible; but the cabin was so nearly destroyed
that the heat could be borne, although it caused
each to hold his breath, it was so intolerable.</p>

<p>Scores of the Wyandots were watching the fugitives,
and whoops and shouts of exultation rent
the air, as a dozen advanced to meet the captives.</p>

<p>The latter hurried forward a few paces more,
when Jo Stinger shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now run for your lives!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>They were within fifty feet of the open door of
the second cabin, through which he plunged the
next instant like a cannon-shot, the others following
pell-mell. The movement was so sudden and
unexpected by the Wyandots crowding forward
that it was virtually finished before they could
interfere.</p>

<p>Ned Preston purposely threw himself behind
the others, that he might, so far as possible, help
protect his aunt and cousins. He was about to
follow them into the building, when one warrior,
more agile than the other, bounded forward with
uplifted tomahawk.</p>

<p>Before he could throw it, and before Ned
could use his gun, a resounding twang was heard
from the nearest window, and an arrow from the
royal bow of Deerfoot the Shawanoe transfixed
him.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was inside in a twinkling. The
Wyandots, infuriated over the trick played them,
made a rush, with the intention of forcing an
entrance at all hazards; but they were met by a
rattling fire, which sent them skurrying like rabbits
to cover. Every window seemed to bristle
with rifles, and the shots were so numerous that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Waughtauk and his warriors saw that others than
the fugitives were defending the building.</p>

<p>Such was the fact. When Macaiah Preston, the
leading settler at Wild Oaks, sent Deerfoot to
apprise Colonel Preston of his danger, he did not
contemplate doing anything more. But his own
son was involved, and he became so uneasy that
he consulted his neighbors, who agreed that help
should be dispatched to Fort Bridgman without
delay.</p>

<p>Accompanied by ten skilled riflemen, all of
whom had seen service on the frontier, he set out
for the station thirty miles away. He reached
the neighborhood quite late at night of the second
day of the siege, and on the way he met and was
joined by Deerfoot, who had started to obtain his
help.</p>

<p>As the Wyandots felt certain of their prey, they
had relaxed their vigilance to a great extent. It
was a curious fact that, while Jo Stinger was engaged
on his reconnoissance, Deerfoot and several
of the new arrivals were doing the same, although
neither suspected the presence of the other.</p>

<p>The plan of Waughtauk was soon learned, and
it was then decided to enter the cabin, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
guided by events. This was a task of extreme
difficulty, but with the assistance of Deerfoot, who
was the first to open the way, they got within the
building without detection by their enemies.
Then, with loaded and cocked rifles, they held
themselves ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>As the crisis approached, Deerfoot purposely
showed himself to the garrison, that they might
recognize him and learn that they were not
deserted. At the same time Macaiah Preston
made several guarded signals to Jo Stinger, which
that scout saw and understood, though no one else
did. He said nothing to his friends, but it was
this knowledge which gave such assurance to his
movements.</p>

<p>The numbers within the cabin rendered it practically
impregnable to twice the force at the command
of Waughtauk, chieftain of the Wyandots.
The illumination from the burning embers was so
full that any warrior who ventured to show himself
was riddled before he could approach within
a hundred feet of the building.</p>

<p>This "electric light" lasted until after daylight,
at which hour not a solitary hostile was visible.
The single structure that had been left standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
contained a stronger force than that of the red
men who had destroyed the other two.</p>

<p>There was no move made until noon, when
Deerfoot ventured into the woods on a careful and
prolonged reconnoissance. When he came back, he
reported of a verity that Waughtauk and his Indians
had gone, and in all probability were miles
distant.</p>

<p>It was deemed best, however, for the settlers to
stay where they were, until the succeeding morning.
This was done, and, at an early hour, the
whole company started for Wild Oaks, on the
Ohio.</p>

<p>The journey was ended without special incident,
and just as the sun went down behind the western
wilderness, the settlement was reached, and all
danger was past.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" exclaimed Colonel Preston,
looking reverently upward; "we have been saved
by fire indeed."</p>

<p>"And did you ever think we wouldn't be?"
asked Susie, his younger daughter.</p>

<p>"Well, I must own that I gave up once."</p>

<p>"That is wicked, papa," said the little one reproachfully;
"I <i>knew</i> God would take care of us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
all, and the bad Indians wouldn't hurt us, 'cause
Mary and I prayed to Him, and He heard us."</p>

<p>"God bless you&mdash;I believe you!" replied the
father, with misty eyes, as he tossed the darlings
in air one after the other, caught them in his arms,
and kissed them again and again.</p>

<p>We have not dwelt on the meeting in the cabin,
which survived the flames, between the despairing
fugitives and their rescuers. Its joyful nature
may be imagined. The countenance of the handsome,
willowy young Shawanoe was aglow with
pleasure, when he grasped the hand of the no less
delighted Ned Preston, who had believed him dead
until he saw him walk forth in the glare of the
burning building.</p>

<p>"You must come and live with us," said Ned,
at the end of the journey, and after the others
had thanked the wonderful youth for his services,
which were beyond value.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will visit his friends," said he, holding
the hand of Ned, and looking affectionately in
the face of the youthful pioneer; "but his home is
in the woods. He loves to lie under the trees and
listen to the sighing of the wind among the
branches; he loves to watch the clouds, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
float like snowy canoes across the blue sky; he
loves to listen to the soft flow of the river, to crawl
under the edge of the rock, and hear the snowflakes
sifting down on the brown leaves; his soul
rejoices at the crashing of the thunderbolts, which
split the trees like rotten fruit. When Deerfoot is
tired, he can wrap his blanket around him and sleep
anywhere; when he is hungry, he has his bow and
arrow which can bring down the deer, and the
bear, and the bison; when he is thirsty, he can
drink the cold water which drips from the mossy
rocks; when he is in trouble, he will pray to the
Great Spirit of the white man, who will not turn
his ear away.</p>

<p>"No, Deerfoot must live in the forests, but he
will always love the pale-faces, and perhaps,"
added the Shawanoe, looking Ned Preston straight
in the eye, "it may be the fortune of Deerfoot to
be of help again to you."</p>

<p>"I know how gladly it will be given," said Ned
gratefully; "and if there ever should come any
need of <i>our</i> help, it will be the pleasure of our
lives to prove how much we appreciate your
friendship."</p>

<p>The sun had gone down, and the shadows of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
night were creeping through the dim, silent woods,
when Deerfoot the Shawanoe crossed the clearing
which surrounded the settlement, and, pausing on
the border of the forest, he waved a good-bye to
his friends. Then he turned and vanished from
sight.</p>

<p>But there seemed to rest the mantle of prophecy
on his graceful shoulders, when he intimated that
it might be his good fortune to render service to
Ned Preston and his friends. The opportunity
came sooner than any one anticipated, and what
befell the boy pioneer, and what was done by the
young Shawanoe, will be told in the second volume
of the "Boy Pioneer Series," entitled&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HORATIO ALGER, JR.</p>

<p>The enormous sales of the books of Horatio Alger, Jr.,
show the greatness of his popularity among the boys, and
prove that he is one of their most favored writers. I am told
that more than half a million copies altogether have been
sold, and that all the large circulating libraries in the country
have several complete sets, of which only two or three volumes
are ever on the shelves at one time. If this is true,
what thousands and thousands of boys have read and are
reading Mr. Alger's books! His peculiar style of stories,
often imitated but never equaled, have taken a hold upon the
young people, and, despite their similarity, are eagerly read
as soon as they appear.</p>

<p>Mr. Alger became famous with the publication of that
undying book, "Ragged Dick, or Street Life in New York."
It was his first book for young people, and its success was so
great that he immediately devoted himself to that kind of
writing. It was a new and fertile field for a writer then, and
Mr. Alger's treatment of it at once caught the fancy of the
boys. "Ragged Dick" first appeared in 1868, and ever since
then it has been selling steadily, until now it is estimated
that about 200,000 copies of the series have been sold.</p>

A writer for boys should have an abundant sympathy
with them. He should be able to enter into their plans,
hopes, and aspirations. He should learn to look upon life
as they do. Boys object to be written down to. A boy's
heart opens to the man or writer who understands him.</p>

<hr class="l05" />
<p class="center"><b>HOW I CAME TO WRITE MY FIRST BOOK.</b></p>

<p>When I was sixteen years old I belonged to a composition
class. It was our custom to go on the recitation seat
every day with clean slates, and we were allowed ten minutes
to write seventy words on any subject the teacher
thought suited to our capacity. One day he gave out "What
a Man Would See if He Went to Greenland." My heart was
in the matter, and before the ten minutes were up I had one
side of my slate filled. The teacher listened to the reading
of our compositions, and when they were all over he simply
said: "Some of you will make your living by writing one
of these days." That gave me something to ponder upon.
I did not say so out loud, but I knew that my composition
was as good as the best of them. By the way, there was
another thing that came in my way just then. I was reading
at that time one of Mayne Reid's works which I had
drawn from the library, and I pondered upon it as much as
I did upon what the teacher said to me. In introducing
Swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression:
"No visible change was observable in Swartboy's countenance."
 Now, it occurred to me that if a man of his education
could make such a blunder as that and still write a
book, I ought to be able to do it, too. I went home that very
day and began a story, "The Old Guide's Narrative," which
was sent to the <i>New York Weekly</i>, and came back, respectfully
declined. It was written on both sides of the sheets
but I didn't know that this was against the rules. Nothing
abashed, I began another, and receiving some instruction,
from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store, I
wrote it on only one side of the paper. But mind you, he
didn't know what I was doing. Nobody knew it; but one
day, after a hard Saturday's work&mdash;the other boys had been
out skating on the brick-pond&mdash;I shyly broached the subject
to my mother. I felt the need of some sympathy. She
listened in amazement, and then said: "Why, do you think
you could write a book like that?" That settled the matter,
and from that day no one knew what I was up to until I sent
the first four volumes of Gunboat Series to my father. Was
it work? Well, yes; it was hard work, but each week I had
the satisfaction of seeing the manuscript grow until the
"Young Naturalist" was all complete.</p>

<p class="center p6 b12">EDWARD S. ELLIS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward S. Ellis</span>, the popular writer of boys' books, is
a native of Ohio, where he was born somewhat more than a
half-century ago. His father was a famous hunter and rifle
shot, and it was doubtless his exploits and those of his associates,
with their tales of adventure which gave the son his
taste for the breezy backwoods and for depicting the stirring
life of the early settlers on the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis began writing at an early age and his work was
acceptable from the first. His parents removed to New
Jersey while he was a boy and he was graduated from the
State Normal School and became a member of the faculty
while still in his teens. He was afterward principal of the
Trenton High School, a trustee and then superintendent of
schools. By that time his services as a writer had become
so pronounced that he gave his entire attention to literature.
He was an exceptionally successful teacher and wrote a number
of text-books for schools, all of which met with high
favor. For these and his historical productions, Princeton
College conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>The high moral character, the clean, manly tendencies
and the admirable literary style of Mr. Ellis' stories have
made him as popular on the other side of the Atlantic as in
this country. A leading paper remarked some time since,
that no mother need hesitate to place in the hands of her boy
any book written by Mr. Ellis. They are found in the leading
Sunday-school libraries, where, as may well be believed,
they are in wide demand and do much good by their sound,
wholesome lessons which render them as acceptable to parents
as to their children. All of his books published by Henry
T. Coates &amp; Co. are re-issued in London, and many have
been translated into other languages. Mr. Ellis is a writer
of varied accomplishments, and, in addition to his stories, is
the author of historical works, of a number of pieces of popular
music and has made several valuable inventions. Mr.
Ellis is in the prime of his mental and physical powers, and
great as have been the merits of his past achievements, there
is reason to look for more brilliant productions from his pen
in the near future.</p>
